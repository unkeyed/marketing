## Roles Returned as Part of `verifyKey`

The `/v1/keys.verifyKey` endpoint has been updated to include a list of roles associated with the key in the verification response, enabling applications to easily determine the user's roles during key verification and make more informed authorization decisions. This simplifies role-based access control implementation and requires one less API request.

## Seeding Local Development

We have introduced proper seeding for log pages and metrics, enhancing the ability to generate realistic test data and improving the development and testing experience. You can easily seed a workspace by running `pnpm local` and selecting `Seed Clickhouse/DB`. Our CLI will then ask a series of questions about what you would like to seed and how much test data you want.
