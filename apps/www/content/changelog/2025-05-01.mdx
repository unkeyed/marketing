## New Features




# AI-Enhanced Changelog

Changes from 2025-01-24 to 2025-04-29

## Summary

This release focuses on enhancing the user experience, improving performance and stability, and introducing new features while refining the underlying infrastructure.  Significant improvements have been made to the UI with fixes for tooltip timestamps, table regressions, key name overflows, and improved responsiveness on various pages. The user interface has also been improved with a new key creation wizard, redesigned user button, a workspace list instead of a select, and general UI fixes.

A substantial effort has been dedicated to backend enhancements, with the introduction of a new API server (v2), and new API endpoints for identity management. Performance optimizations are achieved by preventing unnecessary revalidation of logs and charts. Stability and reliability have been addressed through fixes for broken tests, session handling issues, and error formatting of AI searches. The rate limiting mechanism has been refined with an improved metrics collection. Furthermore, the codebase has undergone significant refactoring to remove unnecessary code and dependencies, improving efficiency.

Security and access control have been fortified by restricting access to membership list fetching to the current organization context and enhancing error handling for expired pending sessions. Audit logging has been improved with added details to key deletion events. The codebase has also been updated to address security vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance.

Finally, efforts have been made to enrich documentation.  API guides have been enhanced with authentication and error handling instructions. Also, guides on RESTful API design, API Documentation-Driven Design, and an explanation of how delete protection works have been added. The ratelimit SDK has been moved to a more appropriate repository, and CI/CD workflows have been optimized for efficiency, reducing test times by running only relevant tests based on code changes.
