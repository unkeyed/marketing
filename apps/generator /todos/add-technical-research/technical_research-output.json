They facilitate the creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger and sometimes a [software framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework). They are normally specific to a hardware platform and operating system combination. To create applications with advanced functionalities such as advertisements, push notifications, etc; most [application software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software) developers use specific software development kits.\n\nSome SDKs are required for developing a platform-specific app. For example, the development of an Android app on the Java platform requires a [Java Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit). For iOS applications (apps) the [iOS SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_SDK) is required. For Universal Windows Platform the [.NET Framework SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_SDK) might be used. There are also SDKs that add additional features and can be installed in apps to provide analytics, data about application activity, and monetization options. Some prominent creators of these types of SDKs include Google, Smaato, InMobi, and Facebook.\n\n## Details\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Software_development_kit&action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\nAn SDK can take the form of [application programming interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-SandovalWhatIs16-1) in the form of on-device [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) of reusable functions used to interface to a particular [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), or it may be as complex as hardware-specific tools that can communicate with a particular [embedded system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system).[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-BensoASoft00-2) Common [tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_tool) include debugging facilities and other [utilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_program), often presented in an [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-BurdAndroid15-3) SDKs may include sample software and/or technical notes along with documentation, and tutorials to help clarify points made by the primary reference material.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-AsifNext11-4)[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-WitheeSharePoint11-5)\n\nSDKs often include [licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility) that make them unsuitable for building software intended to be developed under an incompatible license. For example, a proprietary SDK is generally incompatible with [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) development, while a [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)'d SDK could be incompatible with proprietary software development, for legal reasons.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-Vaughan-NicholsNoGoogle13-6)[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-OrlandSonys17-7) However, SDKs built under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License) are typically usable for proprietary development.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-DavidsonAPrimer04-8) In cases where the underlying technology is new, SDKs may include hardware. For example, [AirTag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirTag)'s 2021 [near-field communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication) SDK included both the paying and the reading halves of the necessary hardware stack.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-9)\n\nThe average [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) [mobile app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) implements 15.6 separate SDKs, with gaming apps implementing on average 17.5 different SDKs.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-SafeDK-10) The most popular SDK categories for Android mobile apps are analytics and advertising.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-SafeDK-10)\n\nSDKs can be unsafe (because they are implemented within apps yet run separate code). Malicious SDKs (with honest intentions or not) can violate users' [data privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_privacy), damage app performance, or even cause apps to be banned from [Google Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play) or the [App Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(Apple)).[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-TechCrunch-11) New technologies allow [app developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer) to control and monitor client SDKs in real time.\n\nProviders of SDKs for specific systems or [subsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsystems) sometimes substitute a more specific term instead of _software_. For instance, both [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft)[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-MicrosoftWDK-12) and [Citrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrix_Systems)[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_note-CitrixDDK17-13) provide a driver development kit for developing [device drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver).\n\n## Examples\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Software_development_kit&action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nExamples of software development kits for various platforms include:\n\n- [AmigaOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaOS) NDK\n- [Android NDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_NDK)\n- [iOS SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_SDK)\n- [Java Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit)\n- [Java Web Services Development Pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Web_Services_Development_Pack)\n- [Microsoft Windows SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_SDK)\n- [VaxTele SIP Server SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VaxTele_SIP_Server_SDK)\n- [Visage SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visage_SDK)\n- [Vuforia Augmented Reality SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuforia_Augmented_Reality_SDK)\n- [Windows App SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_App_SDK)\n- [Xbox Development Kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Development_Kit)\n\n## See also\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Software_development_kit&action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\n- [Game development kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_development_kit)\n- [Widget toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_toolkit)\n\n## References\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Software_development_kit&action=edit&section=4)\\]\n\n01. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit#cite_ref-SandovalWhatIs16_1-0)**Sandoval, K.

There's one MacOS X SDK and one iOS SDK, for example, and those each contain the API's for many different areas of functionality.\n\n\"API\" was originally used as a collective term as well, and it's still often used that way (MAPI, WSAPI, etc.), but it's usually limited to some particular technology. The scope implied by the \"API\" seems to have diminished over the years; people used to talk about the \"Mac Toolbox API\" or the \"Windows API,\" both of which obviously contained a _lot_ of functionality. These days, it's not uncommon to hear \"API\" used to mean a single system function; a new version of an operating system might be said to contain hundreds of new API's, and what's meant is hundreds of new system calls.\n\nNeither term is very precise without some context.\n\n[Share](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/101889)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/101889/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nanswered Aug 17, 2011 at 21:35\n\n[![Caleb's user avatar](https://i.sstatic.net/uQ5JF.png?s=64)](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/20011/caleb)\n\n[Caleb](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/20011/caleb) Caleb\n\n39.2k88 gold badges9595 silver badges152152 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n- haha----this is my stance exactly. what a broad term and it indeed needs full context since we can implement software to do virtually anything we want it to do via any mechanism or medium necessary---everything has an api and is an api (even an sdk has a command line interface which is in of itself---an api under the hood and at the syntax /argument level---each layer delegates to some compiled binary or a script which is still a binary---e.g. the /bin folder in most project).\n\n– [A-Dubb](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/30097/a-dubb)\n\nCommentedOct 4, 2020 at 20:08\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/101873/whats-the-difference-between-an-api-and-an-sdk) \\|\n\n16\n\n- [http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-api-and-vs-sdk/](http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-api-and-vs-sdk/)\n\n**What is API?**\n\nAPI is an interface that allows software programs to interact with each other. It defines a set of rules that should be followed by the programs to communicate with each other. APIs generally specify how the routines, data structures, etc. should be defined in order for two applications to communicate. APIs differ in the functionality provided by them. There are general APIs that provide library functionalities of a programming language such as the Java API. There are also APIs that provides specific functionalities such as the Google Maps API. There are also language dependent APIs, which could only be used by a specific programming language. Furthermore, there are language independent APIs that could be used with several programming languages. APIs needs to be implemented very carefully by exposing only the required functionality or data to the outside, while keeping the other parts of the application inaccessible. Usage of APIs has become very popular in the internet. It has become very common to allow some of the functionality and data through an API to the outside on the Web. This functionality can be combined to offer an improved functionality to the users.\n\n**What is SDK?**\n\nSDK is a set of tools that can be used to develop software applications targeting a specific platform. SDKs include tools, libraries, documentation and sample code that would help a programmer to develop an application. Most of the SDKs could be downloaded from the internet and many of the SDKs are provided free to encourage the programmers to use the SDK‘s programming language. Some widely used SDKs are Java SDK (JDK) that includes all the libraries, debugging utilities, etc., which would make writing programs much easier in Java. SDKs make the life of a software developer easy, since there is no need to look for components/ tools that are compatible with each other and all of them are integrated in to a single package that is easy to install.\n\n**What is the difference between API and SDK?**\n\nAPI is an interface that allows software programs to interact with each other, whereas a SDK is a set of tools that can be used to develop software applications targeting a specific platform. The simplest version of a SDK could be an API that contains some files required to interact with a specific programming language. So an API can be seen as a simple SDK without all the debugging support, etc.\n\n[Share](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/101949)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/101949/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nanswered Aug 18, 2011 at 5:38\n\n[![chiranjib's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1c73a13e2402b9773cb9ef96ced5dad?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/34547/chiranjib)\n\n[chiranjib](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/34547/chiranjib) chiranjib\n\n26911 silver badge22 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n- I share your sentiment as well as that of @Caleb---it's such a massive and meta term like the indefinite amount of dev roles we have in any given engineering firm.\n\n– [A-Dubb](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/30097/a-dubb)\n\nCommentedOct 4, 2020 at 20:10\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/101873/whats-the-difference-between-an-api-and-an-sdk) \\|\n\n7\n\nAn SDK could be nothing but an API (files to help interface with another app), but usually includes other code to help with debugging and other pieces for your IDE.\n\nI'm all out of acronyms.\n\n[Share](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/101877)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/101877/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nanswered Aug 17, 2011 at 20:52\n\n[![JeffO's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eff18c7951751e1ddb1493d4c806f157?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/855/jeffo)\n\n[JeffO](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/855/jeffo) JeffO\n\n36.8k22 gold badges5858 silver badges125125 bronze badges\n\n2\n\n- 8\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick, get yourself some more TLAs!\n\n– [Mason Wheeler](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/935/mason-wheeler)\n\nCommentedAug 17, 2011 at 22:19\n\n- 4\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm about ready for EIEIO.\n\n– [JeffO](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/855/jeffo)\n\nCommentedAug 18, 2011 at 1:10\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/101873/whats-the-difference-between-an-api-and-an-sdk) \\|\n\n5\n\nEverything mentioned before is true, but about SDK I would like to add that a software development kit is (or should be) a really complete package with (almost) all the necessary tools for the development process, while API is \"just\" an interface to interact with.\n\n[Share](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/101880)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/101880/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nanswered Aug 17, 2011 at 21:08\n\n[![Scorchio's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/36a440552ca16f895a36004ba82e3ecc?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/10138/scorchio)\n\n[Scorchio](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/10138/scorchio) Scorchio\n\n18144 bronze badges\n\n[Add a comment](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/101873/whats-the-difference-between-an-api-and-an-sdk) \\|\n\n2\n\nLots of the other answers explain that an SDK is _tooling_, but none of them directly comes out and says that an API is a _specification_.\n\nThe API for compoonent X is all the information that you need in order to write some other component that will interact with X.

So an application might _have_ an API to allow other applications to communicate with it. And a piece of software (e.g. a class in an OO system) might offer an API to allow other modules in the system to communicate with it.\n\nHowever often the term API is used as a synonym of \"library\". I don't think that's a correct use of the word. _Part_ of the library is an API to allow code to use it, but the library _isn't_ an API.\n\nAnd an SDK is a kind of library, so that's where the confusion might be.\n\n[Share](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/252091)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/252091/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nanswered Aug 2, 2014 at 20:59\n\n[![Aviv Cohn's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/14c5dbaa8ee0ac72887b21fba80a252c?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2)](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/121368/aviv-cohn)\n\n[Aviv Cohn](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/121368/aviv-cohn) Aviv Cohn\n\n21.4k3333 gold badges122122 silver badges181181 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n- 1\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree.

Simplifying the developer's life while enabling access to high-performance compute resources, either in the cloud or on-prem.\n\nFor guided demos and basics walkthroughs, check out the following links:\n\n- Guided demo notebooks available [here](https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare-sdk/tree/main/demo-notebooks/guided-demos), and copies of the notebooks with [expected output](https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare-sdk/tree/main/demo-notebooks/guided-demos/notebook-ex-outputs) also available\n- Note that these notebooks will work with the latest `codeflare-sdk` PyPI release. For testing and experimentation with `main` branch, please use the [preview notebooks](https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare-sdk/tree/main/demo-notebooks/guided-demos/preview_nbs)\n- Additionally, we have a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U76iIfd9EmE) of these basic demos from June, 2023\n\nFull documentation can be found [here](https://project-codeflare.github.io/codeflare-sdk/detailed-documentation)\n\n## Installation\n\nCan be installed via `pip`: `pip install codeflare-sdk`\n\n## Development\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nWe recommend using Python 3.9 for development, along with Poetry.\nCreate a Poetry virtual environment with the required Python version 3.9, and run all commands within this environment.\n\n- run: `poetry shell`\n\n#### Install dependencies:\n\n- run: `poetry install`\n\nThis will install standard requirements as specified in the poetry.lock file. Test and docs dependencies are optional.\n\n- To include test dependencies run: `poetry install --with test`\n\n- To include docs dependencies run: `poetry install --with docs`\n\n- To include test and docs dependencies run: `poetry install --with test,docs`\n\n\nIf you require a requirements.txt file you can run:\n\n`poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt --without-hashes`\n\n### Pre-commit\n\nWe use pre-commit to make sure the code is consistently formatted. To make sure that pre-commit is run every time you commit changes, simply run `pre-commit install`\n\nTo build the codeflare-sdk pre-commit image run `podman build -f .github/build/Containerfile .` from the root directory.\n\n### Testing\n\n- To install codeflare-sdk in editable mode, run `pip install -e .` from the repo root.\n- Any new test functions/scripts can be added into the `tests` folder\n- NOTE: Functional tests coming soon, will live in `tests/func_test.py`\n\n#### Unit Testing\n\n- To run the unit tests, run `pytest -v tests/unit_test.py`\n\n#### Local e2e Testing\n\n- Please follow the [e2e documentation](https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare-sdk/blob/main/docs/e2e.md)\n\n#### Code Coverage\n\n- Run tests with the following command: `coverage run -m --source=src pytest tests/unit_test.py`\n- To then view a code coverage report w/ missing lines, run `coverage report -m`\n\n### Code Formatting\n\n- To check file formatting, in top-level dir run `black --check .`\n- To auto-reformat all files, remove the `--check` flag\n- To reformat an individual file, run `black `\n\n### Package Build\n\nTo build the python package: `$ poetry build`\n\n## Release Instructions\n\n### Automated Releases\n\nIt is possible to use the Release Github workflow to do the release. This is generally the process we follow for releases\n\n### Manual Releases\n\nThe following instructions apply when doing release manually. This may be required in instances where the automation is failing.\n\n- Check and update the version in \"pyproject.toml\" file.\n- Generate new documentation.\n`pdoc --html -o docs src/codeflare_sdk && pushd docs && rm -rf cluster job utils && mv codeflare_sdk/* . && rm -rf codeflare_sdk && popd && find docs -type f -name \"*.html\" -exec bash -c \"echo '' >> {}\" \\;` (it is possible to install **pdoc** using the following command `poetry install --with docs`)\n- Commit all the changes to the repository.\n- Create Github release ( [https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release)).\n- Build the Python package. `poetry build`\n- If not present already, add the API token to Poetry.\n`poetry config pypi-token.pypi API_TOKEN`\n- Publish the Python package. `poetry publish`\n- Change directory to custom-nb-image. `cd custom-nb-image`\n- Set tag `export tag=TAG`\n- Build the container image. `podman build --build-arg SDK_VERSION= -t quay.io/project-codeflare/notebook:${tag} .`\n- Login to quay.io. `podman login quay.io`\n- Push the image. `podman push quay.io/project-codeflare/notebook:${tag}`\n- Push the stable image tag `podman push quay.io/project-codeflare/notebook:${tag} quay.io/project-codeflare/notebook:stable`\n\n## About\n\nAn intuitive, easy-to-use python interface for batch resource requesting, access, job submission, and observation.

The term software development kit is generally used to refer to a set of resources made available by a platform vendors to enable development on that particular platform.\n\nThe contents of an SDK are very much dependent on what is neccessary to give developers in order for them to successfully build software for that platform.\n\nTypically an SDK will include:\n\n- API and / or achitecture dcumentation:\n\nThis typically includes information such as class and method documentation and code samples to demonstrate the use of each method or class.\n- Library Files\n\nAny binary or source file that is neccessary or helpful to developers using the platform. For example, the Windows SDK includes windows.h which is the main header file for Win32 development.\n- Develoopment Tools and Utilities\n\nApplications created by the platform vendor in order to assist developers in creating applications. These may include compilers or other tools such as emulators and debuggers to enable code to be writen and tested, as well as other applications which are non-essential but useful in software development.\n- Sample Applications\n\nThese are complete, usually small, applications written by the platform vendor in order to demonstrate some specific aspect of the platform. These applications often come with source code to help the developer better understand how the application is using the platform.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1081922)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/1081922/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Dec 2, 2016 at 12:28](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/1081922/revisions)\n\n[![kayess's user avatar](https://i.sstatic.net/y0dE2.png?s=64)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4805174/kayess)\n\n[kayess](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4805174/kayess)\n\n3,39499 gold badges2929 silver badges4646 bronze badges\n\nanswered Jul 4, 2009 at 10:10\n\n[![Crippledsmurf's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25863178f35ae54b9a9245a0210f28a5?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/35031/crippledsmurf)\n\n[Crippledsmurf](https://stackoverflow.com/users/35031/crippledsmurf) Crippledsmurf\n\n4,00211 gold badge3232 silver badges5151 bronze badges\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1081864/sdk-what-is-it-exactly-how-it-could-be-useful) \\|\n\n7\n\nSDK stands for [Software Development Kit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit). It is essential for a developer to have the SDK for the technology he/she is working on.\n\nFor example, Qt SDK contains Designer, Assistant (documentation) and Qt Creator (IDE); and also includes `qmake` and libraries for developing Qt software.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1081869)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/1081869/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Jul 4, 2009 at 9:36](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/1081869/revisions)\n\nanswered Jul 4, 2009 at 9:23\n\n[![Alan Haggai Alavi's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b56a740041997df881354ef8c97496d7?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/66353/alan-haggai-alavi)\n\n[Alan Haggai Alavi](https://stackoverflow.com/users/66353/alan-haggai-alavi) Alan Haggai Alavi\n\n73.6k1919 gold badges104104 silver badges127127 bronze badges\n\n2\n\n- 1\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it differ from a language compiler or help of a programming language?\n\n– [odiseh](https://stackoverflow.com/users/61156/odiseh)\n\nCommentedJul 4, 2009 at 9:31\n\n- 1\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will include the libraries/other API required for developing for the specific requirement.

Furthermore, as new features and capabilities\nare added to the SDK, your taps and targets can always take advantage of the latest\ncapabilities and bug fixes, simply by updating your SDK dependency to the latest version.\n\n## Meltano\n\n_Not familiar with Meltano?_ [Meltano](https://docs.meltano.com/getting-started/meltano-at-a-glance) is your CLI for ELT+ that:\n\n- **Starts simple**: Meltano is pip-installable and comes in a prepackaged docker container, you can have your first ELT pipeline running within minutes.\n- **Has DataOps out-of-the-box**: Meltano provides tools that make DataOps best practices easy to use in every project.\n- **Integrates with everything**: 300+ natively supported data sources & targets, as well as additional plugins like great expectations or dbt are natively available.\n- **Is easily customizable**: Meltano isn't just extensible, it's built to be extended! The Singer SDK (for Connectors) & EDK (for Meltano Components) are easy to use. Meltano Hub helps you find all of the connectors and components created across the data community.\n- **Is a mature system**: Developed since 2018, runs in production at large companies like GitLab, and currently powers over a million pipeline runs monthly.\n- **Has first class ELT tooling built-in**: Extract data from any data source, load into any target, use inline maps to transform on data on the fly, and test the incoming data, all in one package.\n\nIf you want to get started with Meltano, we suggest you:\n\n- head over to the [Installation](https://docs.meltano.com/getting-started/installation)\n- or if you have it installed, go through the [Meltano Tutorial](https://docs.meltano.com/getting-started/part1).\n\n## Documentation\n\n- See our [online documentation](https://sdk.meltano.com) for instructions on how\nto get started with the SDK.\n\n## Contributing back to the SDK\n\n- For more information on how to contribute, see our [Contributors Guide](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html).\n\n## Making a new release of the SDK\n\n1. Trigger a version bump [using the GitHub web UI](https://github.com/edgarrmondragon/sdk/actions/workflows/version_bump.yml) or the cli:\n\n\n\n```\n$ gh workflow run\n```\n\n\n\nThe `increment: auto` option will figure out the most appropriate bump based on commit history.\n\n2. Follow the checklist in the PR description.\n\n3. Publish a new release [using the GitHub web UI](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/new).\n\n\n## About\n\nWrite 70% less code by using the SDK to build custom extractors and loaders that adhere to the Singer standard: [https://sdk.meltano.com](https://sdk.meltano.com)\n\n[sdk.meltano.com](https://sdk.meltano.com)\n\n### Topics\n\n[python](https://github.com/topics/python) [sdk](https://github.com/topics/sdk)\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/meltano/sdk#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[Apache-2.0 license](https://github.com/meltano/sdk#Apache-2.0-1-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/activity)\n\n[Custom properties](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/custom-properties)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**86**\\\nstars](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**6**\\\nwatching](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**61**\\\nforks](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmeltano%2Fsdk&report=meltano+%28user%29)\n\n## [Releases\\ 64](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases)\n\n[v0.37.0Latest\\\n\\\nApr 29, 2024](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases/tag/v0.37.0)\n\n[\\+ 63 releases](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/releases)\n\n## [Used by 1k](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/network/dependents)\n\n[- ![@hotgluexyz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65564016?s=64&v=4)\\\n- ![@afonsodiniz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48129227?s=64&v=4)\\\n- ![@DmitreyZl](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70319100?s=64&v=4)\\\n- ![@SaneFYI](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120215350?s=64&v=4)\\\n- ![@reidlai](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3723369?s=64&v=4)\\\n- ![@olbycom](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96593634?s=64&v=4)\\\n- ![@hotgluexyz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65564016?s=64&v=4)\\\n- ![@Automattic](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/887802?s=64&v=4)\\\n\\+ 1,032](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/network/dependents)\n\n## [Contributors\\ 72](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/graphs/contributors)\n\n[\\+ 58 contributors](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Languages\n\n- [Python100.0%](https://github.com/meltano/sdk/search?l=python)\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.",

Read more in\nthe [introduction blog post](https://www.openshift.com/blog/introducing-the-operator-framework).\n\n[Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) make it easy to manage complex stateful\napplications on top of Kubernetes. However writing an Operator today can\nbe difficult because of challenges such as using low level APIs, writing\nboilerplate, and a lack of modularity which leads to duplication.\n\nThe Operator SDK is a framework that uses the\n[controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) library to make writing\noperators easier by providing:\n\n- High level APIs and abstractions to write the operational logic more intuitively\n- Tools for scaffolding and code generation to bootstrap a new project fast\n- Extensions to cover common Operator use cases\n\n## Dependency and platform support\n\n### Go version\n\nRelease binaries will be built with the Go compiler version specified in the [developer guide](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/contribution-guidelines/developer-guide#prerequisites).\nA Go Operator project's Go version can be found in its `go.mod` file.\n\n### Kubernetes versions\n\nSupported Kubernetes versions for your Operator project or relevant binary can be determined\nby following this [compatibility guide](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/overview#kubernetes-version-compatibility).\n\n### Platforms\n\nThe set of supported platforms for all binaries and images can be found in [these tables](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/overview#platform-support).\n\n## Community and how to get involved\n\n- [Operator framework community](https://github.com/operator-framework/community)\n- [Communication channels](https://github.com/operator-framework/community#get-involved)\n- [Project meetings](https://github.com/operator-framework/community#meetings)\n\n## How to contribute\n\nCheck out the [contributor documentation](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/contribution-guidelines/).\n\n## License\n\nOperator SDK is under Apache 2.0 license.

navigation\n\n## Welcome to dotnet sdk\n\nThis repository contains core functionality needed to create .NET projects that are shared between Visual Studio and the [.NET CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/).\n\n- MSBuild tasks are under [/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks).\n\nSee [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system) for the project system work that is specific to Visual Studio.\n\nCommon project and item templates are found in [template\\_feed](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/tree/main/template_feed).\n\n## Build

|\n\n## Installing the SDK\n\nYou can download the .NET SDK as either an installer (MSI, PKG) or a zip (zip, tar.gz). The .NET SDK contains both the .NET runtime and CLI tools.\n\n- [Official builds](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)\n- [**Latest builds table**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\nNote\n\nWhen acquiring installers from the latest builds table, be aware that the installers are the **latest bits**. With development builds, internal NuGet feeds are necessary for some scenarios (for example, to acquire the runtime pack for self-contained apps). You can use the following NuGet.config to configure these feeds. See the following document [Configuring NuGet behavior](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/configuring-nuget-behavior) for more information on where to modify your NuGet.config to apply the changes.\n\n### For .NET 9 builds\n\n```\n \n \n \n \n \n```\n\n### For .NET 8 builds\n\n```\n \n \n \n \n \n```\n\n### Debian package dependencies\n\nOur Debian packages are put together slightly differently than the other OS specific installers. Instead of combining everything, we have separate component packages that depend on each other. If you're installing the SDK from the .deb file (via dpkg or similar), then you'll need to install the corresponding dependencies first:\n\n- [Host, Host FX Resolver, and Shared Framework](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [ASP.NET Core Shared Framework](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/DailyBuilds.md)\n\n### Looking for dotnet-install sources?\n\nSources for dotnet-install.sh and dotnet-install.ps1 are in the [install-scripts repo](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts).\n\n## How do I engage and contribute?\n\nWe welcome you to try things out, [file issues](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues), make feature requests and join us in design conversations. Be sure to check out our [project documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation)\n\nThis project has adopted the [.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct) to clarify expected behavior in our community.\n\n## How do I build the SDK?\n\nStart with the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/project-docs/developer-guide.md).\n\n## How do I test an SDK I have built?\n\nTo test your locally built SDK, run `eng\\dogfood.cmd` after building. That script starts a new Powershell with the environment configured to redirect SDK resolution to your build.\n\nFrom that shell your SDK is available in:\n\n- any Visual Studio instance launched via `& devenv.exe`\n- `dotnet build`\n- `msbuild`\n\n## How do I determine the timeline I must follow to get my changes in for a specific version of .NET?\n\nPlease see the [Pull Request Timeline Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/project-docs/SDK-PR-guide.md).\n\n## How we triage and review PRs\n\nWith the SDK repository being the home for many different areas, we've started trying to label incoming issues for the area they are related to using `Area-` labels. Then we rely on the [codeowners](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) to manage and triages issues in their areas. Feel free to contact the owners listed in that file if you're not getting a response on a particular issue or PR. Please try to label new issues as that'll help us route them faster.\n\nFor issues related to the central SDK team, typically they are assigned out to a team member in the first half of each week. Then each member is asked to review and mark those needing further discussion as \"needs team triage\" and otherwise setting a milestone for the issue. Backlog means we will consider it in the future if there is more feedback. Discussion means we have asked for more information from the filer. All other milestones indicate our best estimate for when a fix will be targeted for noting that not all issues will get fixed. If you are not getting a quick response on an issue assigned to a team member, please ping them.\n\nThe example query used for triage of .NET SDK issues can be viewed [here](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3AArea-NuGet+-label%3AArea-format+-label%3AArea-implicitusings+-label%3AArea-SourceBuild+-label%3AArea-Host+-label%3AArea-NativeAOT+-label%3AArea-readytorun+-label%3AArea-websdk+-label%3AArea-watch+-label%3AArea-illink+-label%3AArea-aspnetcore+-label%3AArea-compatibility+-label%3A%22Area-dotnet+test%22+-label%3AArea-FSharp+-label%3AArea-GenAPI+-label%3AArea-ApiCompat+label%3Auntriaged+no%3Amilestone+no%3Aassignee+)\n\nFor PRs, we assign a reviewer once a week on Wednesday, looking only at PRs that are green in the build. If you are contributing:\n\n- Get the PR green.\n- Include a test if possible.\n- Mention `@dotnet-cli` if you want to raise visibility of the PR.\n\n## License\n\nThe .NET SDK project uses the [MIT license](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/LICENSE.TXT).\n\nThe _LICENSE.txt_ and _ThirdPartyNotices.txt_ in any downloaded archives are authoritative.\n\n## About\n\nCore functionality needed to create .NET Core projects, that is shared between Visual Studio and CLI\n\n[dot.net/core](https://dot.net/core)\n\n### Topics\n\n[cli](https://github.com/topics/cli) [visual-studio](https://github.com/topics/visual-studio) [sdk](https://github.com/topics/sdk) [dotnet](https://github.com/topics/dotnet)\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[MIT license](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk#MIT-1-ov-file)\n\n### Code of conduct\n\n[Code of conduct](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk#coc-ov-file)\n\n### Security policy\n\n[Security policy](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk#security-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/activity)\n\n[Custom properties](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/custom-properties)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**2.6k**\\\nstars](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**224**\\\nwatching](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**1k**\\\nforks](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdotnet%2Fsdk&report=dotnet+%28user%29)\n\n## [Releases\\ 181](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/releases)\n\n[.NET 8.0.6Latest\\\n\\\nJun 4, 2024](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/releases/tag/v8.0.106)\n\n[\\+ 180 releases](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/releases)\n\n## [Packages\\ 0](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/packages?repo_name=sdk)\n\nNo packages published\n\n## [Contributors\\ 543](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/graphs/contributors)\n\n[\\+ 529 contributors](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Languages\n\n- [C#95.9%](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/search?l=c%23)\n- [PowerShell1.5%](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/search?l=powershell)\n- [Shell1.3%](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/search?l=shell)\n- [HTML0.9%](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/search?l=html)\n- [C++0.2%](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/search?l=c%2B%2B)\n- [CMake0.1%](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/search?l=cmake)\n- Other0.1%\n\nYou can’t perform that action at this time.",

They are written using standard Web technologies - JavaScript, HTML, and CSS - plus some dedicated JavaScript APIs.\n\nAmong other things, an add-on could:\n\n- Change the appearance or content of particular websites\n- Modify the Firefox user interface\n- Add new features to Firefox\n\nThere are several types of add-ons, but the most common type are extensions.\n\n## [Developing extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons\\#developing_extensions)\n\nIn the past, there were several toolsets for developing Firefox extensions, but as of November 2017, extensions must be built using [WebExtensions APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions). Other toolsets, such as overlay add-ons, bootstrapped add-ons, and the Add-on SDK, are no longer supported.\n\nExtensions written using WebExtensions APIs for Firefox are designed to be cross-browser compatible. In most cases, it will run in Chrome, Edge, and Opera with few if any changes. They are also fully compatible with multiprocess Firefox. You can see [the APIs currently supported in Firefox and other browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs).\n\n### [Extension Workshop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons\\#extension_workshop)\n\nThe [Firefox Extension Workshop](https://extensionworkshop.com) can help you develop extensions for Firefox and give your users simple, yet powerful ways to customize their browsing experience.

The following five key areas are discussed: \n \n Android architecture \n Android security: defense-in-depth approach \n Android application structure \n Android application publishing \n Android application attack surface \n \n Visit the official Android developer documentation website for more details about the Android platform. \n Android Architecture ¶ \n Android is a Linux-based open source platform developed by the Open Handset Alliance (a consortium lead by Google), which serves as a mobile operating system (OS). Today the platform is the foundation for a wide variety of modern technology, such as mobile phones, tablets, wearable tech, TVs, and other smart devices. Typical Android builds ship with a range of pre-installed (\"stock\") apps and support installation of third-party apps through the Google Play store and other marketplaces. \n Android's software stack is composed of several different layers. Each layer defines interfaces and offers specific services. \n \n Kernel: At the lowest level, Android is based on a variation of the Linux Kernel containing some significant additions, including Low Memory Killer, wake locks, the Binder IPC driver, etc. For the purpose of the MASTG, we'll focus on the user-mode part of the OS, where Android significantly differs from a typical Linux distribution. The two most important components for us are the managed runtime used by applications (ART/Dalvik) and Bionic, Android's version of glibc, the GNU C library. \n HAL: On top of the kernel, the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) defines a standard interface for interacting with built-in hardware components. Several HAL implementations are packaged into shared library modules that the Android system calls when required. This is the basis for allowing applications to interact with the device's hardware. For example, it allows a stock phone application to use a device's microphone and speaker. \n Runtime Environment: Android apps are written in Java and Kotlin and then compiled to Dalvik bytecode which can be then executed using a runtime that interprets the bytecode instructions and executes them on the target device. For Android, this is the Android Runtime (ART). This is similar to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) for Java applications, or the Mono Runtime for .NET applications. \n Dalvik bytecode is an optimized version of Java bytecode. It is created by first compiling the Java or Kotlin code to Java bytecode, using the javac and kotlinc compilers respectively, producing .class files. Finally, the Java bytecode is converted to Dalvik bytecode using the d8 tool. Dalvik bytecode is packed within APK and AAB files in the form of .dex files and is used by a managed runtime on Android to execute it on the device. \n \n Before Android 5.0 (API level 21), Android executed bytecode on the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM), where it was translated into machine code at execution time, a process known as just-in-time (JIT) compilation. This enables the runtime to benefit from the speed of compiled code while maintaining the flexibility of code interpretation. \n Since Android 5.0 (API level 21), Android executes bytecode on the Android Runtime (ART) which is the successor of the DVM. ART provides improved performance as well as context information in app native crash reports, by including both Java and native stack information. It uses the same Dalvik bytecode input to maintain backward compatibility. However, ART executes the Dalvik bytecode differently, using a hybrid combination of ahead-of-time (AOT), just-in-time (JIT) and profile-guided compilation. \n \n AOT pre-compiles Dalvik bytecode into native code, and the generated code will be saved on disk with the .oat extension (ELF binary). The dex2oat tool can be used to perform the compilation and can be found at /system/bin/dex2oat on Android devices. AOT compilation is executed during the installation of the app. This makes the application start faster, as no compilation is needed anymore. However, this also means that the install time increases as compared to JIT compilation. Additionally, since applications are always optimized against the current version of the OS, this means that software updates will recompile all previously compiled applications, resulting in a significant increase in the system update time. Finally, AOT compilation will compile the entire application, even if certain parts are never used by the user. \n JIT happens at runtime. \n Profile-guided compilation is a hybrid approach that was introduced in Android 7 (API level 24) to combat the downsides of AOT. At first, the application will use JIT compilation, and Android keeps track of all the parts of the application that are frequently used. This information is stored in an application profile and when the device is idle, a compilation (dex2oat) daemon runs which AOT compiles the identified frequent code paths from the profile. \n \n \n Source: https://lief-project.github.io/doc/latest/tutorials/10_android_formats.html \n Sandboxing: Android apps don't have direct access to hardware resources, and each app runs in its own virtual machine or sandbox. This enables the OS to have precise control over resources and memory access on the device. For instance, a crashing app doesn't affect other apps running on the same device. Android controls the maximum number of system resources allocated to apps, preventing any one app from monopolizing too many resources. At the same time, this sandbox design can be considered as one of the many principles in Android's global defense-in-depth strategy. A malicious third-party application, with low privileges, shouldn't be able to escape its own runtime and read the memory of a victim application on the same device. In the following section we take a closer look at the different defense layers in the Android operating system. Learn more in the section \"Software Isolation\". \n You can find more detailed information in the Google Source article \"Android Runtime (ART)\", the book \"Android Internals\" by Jonathan Levin and the blog post \"Android 101\" by @_qaz_qaz. \n Android Security: Defense-in-Depth Approach ¶ \n The Android architecture implements different security layers that, together, enable a defense-in-depth approach. This means that the confidentiality, integrity or availability of sensitive user-data or applications doesn't hinge on one single security measure. This section brings an overview of the different layers of defense that the Android system provides. The security strategy can be roughly categorized into four distinct domains, each focusing on protecting against certain attack models. \n \n System-wide security \n Software isolation \n Network security \n Anti-exploitation \n \n System-wide security ¶ \n Device encryption ¶ \n Android supports device encryption from Android 2.3.4 (API level 10) and it has undergone some big changes since then. Google imposed that all devices running Android 6.0 (API level 23) or higher had to support storage encryption, although some low-end devices were exempt because it would significantly impact their performance. \n \n \n Full-Disk Encryption (FDE): Android 5.0 (API level 21) and above support full-disk encryption. This encryption uses a single key protected by the user's device password to encrypt and decrypt the user data partition. This kind of encryption is now considered deprecated and file-based encryption should be used whenever possible. Full-disk encryption has drawbacks, such as not being able to receive calls or not having operative alarms after a reboot if the user does not enter the password to unlock. \n \n \n File-Based Encryption (FBE): Android 7.0 (API level 24) supports file-based encryption. File-based encryption allows different files to be encrypted with different keys so they can be deciphered independently. Devices that support this type of encryption support Direct Boot as well. Direct Boot enables the device to have access to features such as alarms or accessibility services even if the user didn't unlock the device. \n \n \n \n Note: you might hear of Adiantum, which is an encryption method designed for devices running Android 9 (API level 28) and higher whose CPUs lack AES instructions. Adiantum is only relevant for ROM developers or device vendors, Android does not provide an API for developers to use Adiantum from applications. As recommended by Google, Adiantum should not be used when shipping ARM-based devices with ARMv8 Cryptography Extensions or x86-based devices with AES-NI. AES is faster on those platforms. \n Further information is available in the Android documentation. \n \n Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) ¶ \n In order for the Android system to perform encryption it needs a way to securely generate, import and store cryptographic keys. We are essentially shifting the problem of keeping sensitive data secure towards keeping a cryptographic key secure. If the attacker can dump or guess the cryptographic key, the sensitive encrypted data can be retrieved. \n Android offers a trusted execution environment in dedicated hardware to solve the problem of securely generating and protecting cryptographic keys. This means that a dedicated hardware component in the Android system is responsible for handling cryptographic key material. Three main modules are responsible for this: \n \n \n Hardware-backed KeyStore: This module offers cryptographic services to the Android OS and third-party apps. It enables apps to perform cryptographic sensitive operations in an TEE without exposing the cryptographic key material. \n \n \n StrongBox: In Android 9 (Pie), StrongBox was introduced, another approach to implement a hardware-backed KeyStore. While previous to Android 9 Pie, a hardware-backed KeyStore would be any TEE implementation that lies outside of the Android OS kernel. StrongBox is an actual complete separate hardware chip that is added to the device on which the KeyStore is implemented and is clearly defined in the Android documentation. You can check programmatically whether a key resides in StrongBox and if it does, you can be sure that it is protected by a hardware security module that has its own CPU, secure storage, and True Random Number Generator (TRNG). All the sensitive cryptographic operations happen on this chip, in the secure boundaries of StrongBox. \n \n \n GateKeeper: The GateKeeper module enables device pattern and password authentication. The security sensitive operations during the authentication process happen inside the TEE that is available on the device. GateKeeper consists of three main components, (1) gatekeeperd which is the service that exposes GateKeeper, (2) GateKeeper HAL, which is the hardware interface and (3) the TEE implementation which is the actual software that implements the GateKeeper functionality in the TEE. \n \n \n Verified Boot ¶ \n We need to have a way to ensure that code that is being executed on Android devices comes from a trusted source and that its integrity is not compromised. In order to achieve this, Android introduced the concept of verified boot. The goal of verified boot is to establish a trust relationship between the hardware and the actual code that executes on this hardware. During the verified boot sequence, a full chain of trust is established starting from the hardware-protected Root-of-Trust (RoT) up until the final system that is running, passing through and verifying all the required boot phases. When the Android system is finally booted you can rest assured that the system is not tampered with. You have cryptographic proof that the code which is running is the one that is intended by the OEM and not one that has been maliciously or accidentally altered. \n Further information is available in the Android documentation. \n Software Isolation ¶ \n Android Users and Groups ¶ \n Even though the Android operating system is based on Linux, it doesn't implement user accounts in the same way other Unix-like systems do. In Android, the multi-user support of the Linux kernel is used to sandbox apps: with a few exceptions, each app runs as though under a separate Linux user, effectively isolated from other apps and the rest of the operating system. \n The file system/core/include/private/android_filesystem_config.h includes a list of the predefined users and groups system processes are assigned to. UIDs (userIDs) for other applications are added as the latter are installed. \n For example, Android 9.0 (API level 28) defines the following system users: \n #define AID_ROOT 0 /* traditional unix root user */ \n #... \n #define AID_SYSTEM 1000 /* system server */ \n #... \n #define AID_SHELL 2000 /* adb and debug shell user */ \n #... \n #define AID_APP_START 10000 /* first app user */ \n... \n \n SELinux ¶ \n Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) uses a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system to further lock down which processes should have access to which resources. Each resource is given a label in the form of user:role:type:mls_level which defines which users are able to execute which types of actions on it. For example, one process may only be able to read a file, while another process may be able to edit or delete the file. This way, by working on a least-privilege principle, vulnerable processes are more difficult to exploit via privilege escalation or lateral movement. \n Further information is available on the Android documentation. \n Permissions ¶ \n Android implements an extensive permissions system that is used as an access control mechanism. It ensures controlled access to sensitive user data and device resources. Android categorizes permissions into different types offering various protection levels. \n \n Prior to Android 6.0 (API level 23), all permissions an app requested were granted at installation (Install-time permissions). From API level 23 onwards, the user must approve some permissions requests during runtime (Runtime permissions). \n \n Further information is available in the Android documentation including several considerations and best practices. \n To learn how to test app permissions refer to the Testing App Permissions section in the \"Android Platform APIs\" chapter. \n Network security ¶ \n TLS by Default ¶ \n By default, since Android 9 (API level 28), all network activity is treated as being executed in a hostile environment. This means that the Android system will only allow apps to communicate over a network channel that is established using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This protocol effectively encrypts all network traffic and creates a secure channel to a server. It may be the case that you would want to use clear traffic connections for legacy reasons. This can be achieved by adapting the res/xml/network_security_config.xml file in the application. \n Further information is available in the Android documentation. \n DNS over TLS ¶ \n System-wide DNS over TLS support has been introduced since Android 9 (API level 28). It allows you to perform queries to DNS servers using the TLS protocol. A secure channel is established with the DNS server through which the DNS query is sent. This assures that no sensitive data is exposed during a DNS lookup. \n Further information is available on the Android Developers blog. \n Anti-exploitation ¶ \n ASLR, KASLR, PIE and DEP ¶ \n Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), which has been part of Android since Android 4.1 (API level 15), is a standard protection against buffer-overflow attacks, which makes sure that both the application and the OS are loaded to random memory addresses making it difficult to get the correct address for a specific memory region or library. In Android 8.0 (API level 26), this protection was also implemented for the kernel (KASLR). ASLR protection is only possible if the application can be loaded at a random place in memory, which is indicated by the Position Independent Executable (PIE) flag of the application. Since Android 5.0 (API level 21), support for non-PIE enabled native libraries was dropped. Finally, Data Execution Prevention (DEP) prevents code execution on the stack and heap, which is also used to combat buffer-overflow exploits. \n Further information is available on the Android Developers blog. \n SECCOMP Filter ¶ \n Android applications can contain native code written in C or C++. These compiled binaries can communicate both with the Android Runtime through Java Native Interface (JNI) bindings, and with the OS through system calls. Some system calls are either not implemented, or are not supposed to be called by normal applications. As these system calls communicate directly with the kernel, they are a prime target for exploit developers. With Android 8 (API level 26), Android has introduced the support for Secure Computing (SECCOMP) filters for all Zygote based processes (i.e. user applications). These filters restrict the available syscalls to those exposed through bionic. \n Further information is available on the Android Developers blog. \n Android Application Structure ¶ \n Communication with the Operating System ¶ \n Android apps interact with system services via the Android Framework, an abstraction layer that offers high-level Java APIs. The majority of these services are invoked via normal Java method calls and are translated to IPC calls to system services that are running in the background. Examples of system services include: \n \n Connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, etc.) \n Files \n Cameras \n Geolocation (GPS) \n Microphone \n \n The framework also offers common security functions, such as cryptography. \n The API specifications change with every new Android release. Critical bug fixes and security patches are usually applied to earlier versions as well. \n Noteworthy API versions: \n \n Android 4.2 (API level 16) in November 2012 (introduction of SELinux) \n Android 4.3 (API level 18) in July 2013 (SELinux became enabled by default) \n Android 4.4 (API level 19) in October 2013 (several new APIs and ART introduced) \n Android 5.0 (API level 21) in November 2014 (ART used by default and many other features added) \n Android 6.0 (API level 23) in October 2015 (many new features and improvements, including granting; detailed permissions setup at runtime rather than all or nothing during installation) \n Android 7.0 (API level 24-25) in August 2016 (new JIT compiler on ART) \n Android 8.0 (API level 26-27) in August 2017 (a lot of security improvements) \n Android 9 (API level 28) in August 2018 (restriction of background usage of mic or camera, introduction of lockdown mode, default HTTPS for all apps) \n Android 10 (API level 29) in September 2019 (access location \"only while using the app\", device tracking prevention, improve secure external storage,) \n Privacy (overview) \n Privacy (details 1) \n Privacy (details 2) \n Security (overview) \n Security (details) \n \n \n Android 11 (API level 30) in September 2020 (scoped storage enforcement, Permissions auto-reset, reduced package visibility, APK Signature Scheme v4) \n Privacy (overview) \n Privacy Behavior changes (all apps) \n Security Behavior changes (all apps) \n Privacy Behavior changes (apps targeting version) \n Security Behavior changes (apps targeting version) \n \n \n Android 12 (API level 31-32) in August 2021 (Material You, Web intent resolution, Privacy Dashboard) \n Security and privacy \n Behavior changes (all apps) \n Behavior changes (apps targeting version) \n \n \n Android 13 (API level 33) in 2022 (Safer exporting of context-registered receivers, new photo picker) \n Security and privacy \n Privacy Behavior changes (all apps) \n Security Behavior changes (all apps) \n Privacy Behavior changes (apps targeting version) \n Security Behavior changes (apps targeting version) \n \n \n Android 14 (API level 34) in 2023: \n Summary of changes \n Security Behavior changes (all apps) \n Security Behavior changes (apps targeting version) \n \n \n \n Android development releases follow a unique structure. They are organized into families and given alphabetical codenames inspired by tasty treats. You can find them all here. \n The App Sandbox ¶ \n Apps are executed in the Android Application Sandbox, which separates the app data and code execution from other apps on the device. As mentioned before, this separation adds a first layer of defense. \n Installation of a new app creates a new directory named after the app package, which results in the following path: /data/data/[package-name]. This directory holds the app's data. Linux directory permissions are set such that the directory can be read from and written to only with the app's unique UID. \n \n We can confirm this by looking at the file system permissions in the /data/data folder. For example, we can see that Google Chrome and Calendar are assigned one directory each and run under different user accounts: \n drwx------ 4 u0_a97 u0_a97 4096 2017 -01-18 14:27 com.android.calendar\ndrwx------ 6 u0_a120 u0_a120 4096 2017 -01-19 12:54 com.android.chrome\n \n Developers who want their apps to share a common sandbox can sidestep sandboxing. When two apps are signed with the same certificate and explicitly share the same user ID (having the sharedUserId in their AndroidManifest.xml files), each can access the other's data directory. See the following example to achieve this in the NFC app: \n &lt;manifest xmlns:android= \"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\" \n package= \"com.android.nfc\" \n android:sharedUserId= \"android.uid.nfc\" &gt; \n \n Linux User Management ¶ \n Android leverages Linux user management to isolate apps. This approach is different from user management usage in traditional Linux environments, where multiple apps are often run by the same user. Android creates a unique UID for each Android app and runs the app in a separate process. Consequently, each app can access its own resources only. This protection is enforced by the Linux kernel. \n Generally, apps are assigned UIDs in the range of 10000 and 99999. Android apps receive a user name based on their UID. For example, the app with UID 10188 receives the user name u0_a188. If the permissions an app requested are granted, the corresponding group ID is added to the app's process. For example, the user ID of the app below is 10188. It belongs to the group ID 3003 (inet). That group is related to android.permission.INTERNET permission. The output of the id command is shown below. \n $ id\n uid = 10188 ( u0_a188) gid = 10188 ( u0_a188) groups = 10188 ( u0_a188),3003 ( inet),\n 9997 ( everybody),50188 ( all_a188) context = u:r:untrusted_app:s0:c512,c768\n \n The relationship between group IDs and permissions is defined in the following file: \n frameworks/base/data/etc/platform.xml \n &lt;permission name= \"android.permission.INTERNET\" &gt; \n &lt;group gid= \"inet\" /&gt; \n &lt;/permission&gt; \n &lt;permission name= \"android.permission.READ_LOGS\" &gt; \n &lt;group gid= \"log\" /&gt; \n &lt;/permission&gt; \n &lt;permission name= \"android.permission.WRITE_MEDIA_STORAGE\" &gt; \n &lt;group gid= \"media_rw\" /&gt; \n &lt;group gid= \"sdcard_rw\" /&gt; \n &lt;/permission&gt; \n \n Zygote ¶ \n The process Zygote starts up during Android initialization. Zygote is a system service for launching apps. The Zygote process is a \"base\" process that contains all the core libraries the app needs. Upon launch, Zygote opens the socket /dev/socket/zygote and listens for connections from local clients. When it receives a connection, it forks a new process, which then loads and executes the app-specific code. \n App Lifecycle ¶ \n In Android, the lifetime of an app process is controlled by the operating system. A new Linux process is created when an app component is started and the same app doesn't yet have any other components running. Android may kill this process when the latter is no longer necessary or when reclaiming memory is necessary to run more important apps. The decision to kill a process is primarily related to the state of the user's interaction with the process. In general, processes can be in one of four states. \n \n A foreground process (e.g., an activity running at the top of the screen or a running BroadcastReceiver) \n \n A visible process is a process that the user is aware of, so killing it would have a noticeable negative impact on user experience. One example is running an activity that's visible to the user on-screen but not in the foreground. \n \n \n A service process is a process hosting a service that has been started with the startService method. Though these processes aren't directly visible to the user, they are generally things that the user cares about (such as background network data upload or download), so the system will always keep such processes running unless there's insufficient memory to retain all foreground and visible processes. \n \n A cached process is a process that's not currently needed, so the system is free to kill it when memory is needed.\nApps must implement callback methods that react to a number of events; for example, the onCreate handler is called when the app process is first created. Other callback methods include onLowMemory, onTrimMemory and onConfigurationChanged. \n \n App Bundles ¶ \n Android applications can be shipped in two forms: the Android Package Kit (APK) file or an Android App Bundle (.aab). Android App Bundles provide all the resources necessary for an app, but defer the generation of the APK and its signing to Google Play. App Bundles are signed binaries which contain the code of the app in several modules. The base module contains the core of the application. The base module can be extended with various modules which contain new enrichments/functionalities for the app as further explained on the developer documentation for app bundle.\nIf you have an Android App Bundle, you can best use the bundletool command line tool from Google to build unsigned APKs in order to use the existing tooling on the APK. You can create an APK from an AAB file by running the following command: \n bundletool build-apks --bundle = /MyApp/my_app.aab --output = /MyApp/my_app.apks\n \n If you want to create signed APKs ready for deployment to a test device, use: \n $ bundletool build-apks --bundle = /MyApp/my_app.aab --output = /MyApp/my_app.apks\n--ks = /MyApp/keystore.jks\n--ks-pass = file:/MyApp/keystore.pwd\n--ks-key-alias = MyKeyAlias\n--key-pass = file:/MyApp/key.pwd\n \n We recommend that you test both the APK with and without the additional modules, so that it becomes clear whether the additional modules introduce and/or fix security issues for the base module. \n Android Manifest ¶ \n Every app has an Android Manifest file, which embeds content in binary XML format. The standard name of this file is AndroidManifest.xml. It is located in the root directory of the app's Android Package Kit (APK) file. \n The manifest file describes the app structure, its components (activities, services, content providers, and intent receivers), and requested permissions. It also contains general app metadata, such as the app's icon, version number, and theme. The file may list other information, such as compatible APIs (minimal, targeted, and maximal SDK version) and the kind of storage it can be installed on (external or internal). \n Here is an example of a manifest file, including the package name (the convention is a reversed URL, but any string is acceptable). It also lists the app version, relevant SDKs, required permissions, exposed content providers, broadcast receivers used with intent filters and a description of the app and its activities: \n &lt;manifest \n package= \"com.owasp.myapplication\" \n android:versionCode= \"0.1\" &gt; \n &lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion= \"12\" \n android:targetSdkVersion= \"22\" \n android:maxSdkVersion= \"25\" /&gt; \n &lt;uses-permission android:name= \"android.permission.INTERNET\" /&gt; \n &lt;provider \n android:name= \"com.owasp.myapplication.MyProvider\" \n android:exported= \"false\" /&gt; \n &lt;receiver android:name= \".MyReceiver\" &gt; \n &lt;intent-filter&gt; \n &lt;action android:name= \"com.owasp.myapplication.myaction\" /&gt; \n &lt;/intent-filter&gt; \n &lt;/receiver&gt; \n &lt;application \n android:icon= \"@drawable/ic_launcher\" \n android:label= \"@string/app_name\" \n android:theme= \"@style/Theme.Material.Light\" &gt; \n &lt;activity \n android:name= \"com.owasp.myapplication.MainActivity\" &gt; \n &lt;intent-filter&gt; \n &lt;action android:name= \"android.intent.action.MAIN\" /&gt; \n &lt;/intent-filter&gt; \n &lt;/activity&gt; \n &lt;/application&gt; \n &lt;/manifest&gt; \n \n The full list of available manifest options is in the official Android Manifest file documentation. \n App Components ¶ \n Android apps are made of several high-level components. The main components are: \n \n Activities \n Fragments \n Intents \n Broadcast receivers \n Content providers and services \n \n All these elements are provided by the Android operating system, in the form of predefined classes available through APIs. \n Activities ¶ \n Activities make up the visible part of any app. There is one activity per screen, so an app with three different screens implements three different activities. Activities are declared by extending the Activity class. They contain all user interface elements: fragments, views, and layouts. \n Each activity needs to be declared in the Android Manifest with the following syntax: \n &lt;activity android:name= \"ActivityName\" &gt; \n &lt;/activity&gt; \n \n Activities not declared in the manifest can't be displayed, and attempting to launch them will raise an exception. \n Like apps, activities have their own life cycle and need to monitor system changes to handle them. Activities can be in the following states: active, paused, stopped, and inactive. These states are managed by the Android operating system. Accordingly, activities can implement the following event managers: \n \n onCreate \n onSaveInstanceState \n onStart \n onResume \n onRestoreInstanceState \n onPause \n onStop \n onRestart \n onDestroy \n \n An app may not explicitly implement all event managers, in which case default actions are taken. Typically, at least the onCreate manager is overridden by the app developers. This is how most user interface components are declared and initialized. onDestroy may be overridden when resources (like network connections or connections to databases) must be explicitly released or specific actions must occur when the app shuts down. \n Fragments ¶ \n A fragment represents a behavior or a portion of the user interface within the activity. Fragments were introduced Android with the version Honeycomb 3.0 (API level 11). \n Fragments are meant to encapsulate parts of the interface to facilitate re-usability and adaptation to different screen sizes. Fragments are autonomous entities in that they include all their required components (they have their own layout, buttons, etc.). However, they must be integrated with activities to be useful: fragments can't exist on their own. They have their own life cycle, which is tied to the life cycle of the Activities that implement them. \n Because fragments have their own life cycle, the Fragment class contains event managers that can be redefined and extended. These event managers included onAttach, onCreate, onStart, onDestroy and onDetach. Several others exist; the reader should refer to the Android Fragment specification for more details. \n Fragments can be easily implemented by extending the Fragment class provided by Android: \n Example in Java: \n public class MyFragment extends Fragment { \n... \n} \n \n Example in Kotlin: \n class MyFragment: Fragment () { \n... \n} \n \n Fragments don't need to be declared in manifest files because they depend on activities. \n To manage its fragments, an activity can use a Fragment Manager (FragmentManager class). This class makes it easy to find, add, remove, and replace associated fragments. \n Fragment Managers can be created via the following: \n Example in Java: \n FragmentManager fm = getFragmentManager (); \n \n Example in Kotlin: \n Fragments don't necessarily have a user interface; they can be a convenient and efficient way to manage background operations pertaining to the app's user interface. A fragment may be declared persistent so that if the system preserves its state even if its Activity is destroyed. \n Content Providers ¶ \n Android uses SQLite to store data permanently: as with Linux, data is stored in files. SQLite is a light, efficient, open source relational data storage technology that does not require much processing power, which makes it ideal for mobile use. An entire API with specific classes (Cursor, ContentValues, SQLiteOpenHelper, ContentProvider, ContentResolver, etc.) is available.\nSQLite is not run as a separate process; it is part of the app.\nBy default, a database belonging to a given app is accessible to this app only. However, content providers offer a great mechanism for abstracting data sources (including databases and flat files); they also provide a standard and efficient mechanism to share data between apps, including native apps. To be accessible to other apps, a content provider needs to be explicitly declared in the manifest file of the app that will share it. As long as content providers aren't declared, they won't be exported and can only be called by the app that creates them. \n Content providers are implemented through a URI addressing scheme: they all use the content:// model. Regardless of the type of sources (SQLite database, flat file, etc.), the addressing scheme is always the same, thereby abstracting the sources and offering the developer a unique scheme. Content providers offer all regular database operations: create, read, update, delete. That means that any app with proper rights in its manifest file can manipulate the data from other apps. \n Services ¶ \n Services are Android OS components (based on the Service class) that perform tasks in the background (data processing, starting intents, and notifications, etc.) without presenting a user interface. Services are meant to run processes long-term. Their system priorities are lower than those of active apps and higher than those of inactive apps. Therefore, they are less likely to be killed when the system needs resources, and they can be configured to automatically restart when enough resources become available. This makes services a great candidate for running background tasks. Please note that Services, like Activities, are executed in the main app thread. A service does not create its own thread and does not run in a separate process unless you specify otherwise. \n Inter-Process Communication ¶ \n As we've already learned, every Android process has its own sandboxed address space. Inter-process communication facilities allow apps to exchange signals and data securely. Instead of relying on the default Linux IPC facilities, Android's IPC is based on Binder, a custom implementation of OpenBinder. Most Android system services and all high-level IPC services depend on Binder. \n The term Binder stands for a lot of different things, including: \n \n Binder Driver: the kernel-level driver \n Binder Protocol: low-level ioctl-based protocol used to communicate with the binder driver \n IBinder Interface: a well-defined behavior that Binder objects implement \n Binder object: generic implementation of the IBinder interface \n Binder service: implementation of the Binder object; for example, location service, and sensor service \n Binder client: an object using the Binder service \n \n The Binder framework includes a client-server communication model. To use IPC, apps call IPC methods in proxy objects. The proxy objects transparently marshall the call parameters into a parcel and send a transaction to the Binder server, which is implemented as a character driver (/dev/binder). The server holds a thread pool for handling incoming requests and delivers messages to the destination object. From the perspective of the client app, all of this seems like a regular method call, all the heavy lifting is done by the Binder framework. \n \n \n Binder Overview - Image source: Android Binder by Thorsten Schreiber \n \n Services that allow other applications to bind to them are called bound services. These services must provide an IBinder interface to clients. Developers use the Android Interface Descriptor Language (AIDL) to write interfaces for remote services. \n ServiceManager is a system daemon that manages the registration and lookup of system services. It maintains a list of name/Binder pairs for all registered services. Services are added with addService and retrieved by name with the static getService method in android.os.ServiceManager: \n Example in Java: \n public static IBinder getService ( String name) { \n try { \n IBinder service = sCache. get ( name); \n if ( service!= null) { \n return service; \n} else { \n return getIServiceManager (). getService ( name); \n} \n} catch ( RemoteException e) { \n Log. e ( TAG, \"error in getService\", e); \n} \n return null; \n} \n \n Example in Kotlin: \n companion object { \n private val sCache: Map &lt; String, IBinder &gt; = ArrayMap () \n fun getService ( name: String): IBinder? { \n try { \n val service = sCache [ name] \n return service?: getIServiceManager (). getService ( name) \n} catch ( e: RemoteException) { \n Log. e ( FragmentActivity. TAG, \"error in getService\", e) \n} \n return null \n} \n} \n \n You can query the list of system services with the service list command. \n $ adb shell service list\nFound 99 services:\n 0 carrier_config: [ com.android.internal.telephony.ICarrierConfigLoader] \n 1 phone: [ com.android.internal.telephony.ITelephony] \n 2 isms: [ com.android.internal.telephony.ISms] \n 3 iphonesubinfo: [ com.android.internal.telephony.IPhoneSubInfo] \n \n Intents ¶ \n Intent messaging is an asynchronous communication framework built on top of Binder. This framework allows both point-to-point and publish-subscribe messaging. An Intent is a messaging object that can be used to request an action from another app component. Although intents facilitate inter-component communication in several ways, there are three fundamental use cases: \n \n Starting an activity \n An activity represents a single screen in an app. You can start a new instance of an activity by passing an intent to startActivity. The intent describes the activity and carries necessary data. \n \n \n Starting a service \n A Service is a component that performs operations in the background, without a user interface. With Android 5.0 (API level 21) and later, you can start a service with JobScheduler. \n \n \n Delivering a broadcast \n A broadcast is a message that any app can receive. The system delivers broadcasts for system events, including system boot and charging initialization. You can deliver a broadcast to other apps by passing an intent to sendBroadcast or sendOrderedBroadcast. \n \n \n \n There are two types of intents. Explicit intents name the component that will be started (the fully qualified class name). For instance: \n Example in Java: \n Intent intent = new Intent ( this, myActivity. myClass); \n \n Example in Kotlin: \n var intent = Intent ( this, myActivity. myClass) \n \n Implicit intents are sent to the OS to perform a given action on a given set of data (The URL of the OWASP website in our example below). It is up to the system to decide which app or class will perform the corresponding service. For instance: \n Example in Java: \n Intent intent = new Intent ( Intent. MY_ACTION, Uri. parse ( \"https://www.owasp.org\")); \n \n Example in Kotlin: \n var intent = Intent ( Intent. MY_ACTION, Uri. parse ( \"https://www.owasp.org\")) \n \n An intent filter is an expression in Android Manifest files that specifies the type of intents the component would like to receive. For instance, by declaring an intent filter for an activity, you make it possible for other apps to directly start your activity with a certain kind of intent. Likewise, your activity can only be started with an explicit intent if you don't declare any intent filters for it. \n Android uses intents to broadcast messages to apps (such as an incoming call or SMS) important power supply information (low battery, for example), and network changes (loss of connection, for instance). Extra data may be added to intents (through putExtra / getExtras). \n Here is a short list of intents sent by the operating system. All constants are defined in the Intent class, and the whole list is in the official Android documentation: \n \n ACTION_CAMERA_BUTTON \n ACTION_MEDIA_EJECT \n ACTION_NEW_OUTGOING_CALL \n ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED \n \n To improve security and privacy, a Local Broadcast Manager is used to send and receive intents within an app without having them sent to the rest of the operating system. This is very useful for ensuring that sensitive and private data don't leave the app perimeter (geolocation data for instance). \n Broadcast Receivers ¶ \n Broadcast Receivers are components that allow apps to receive notifications from other apps and from the system itself. With them, apps can react to events (internal, initiated by other apps, or initiated by the operating system). They are generally used to update user interfaces, start services, update content, and create user notifications. \n There are two ways to make a Broadcast Receiver known to the system. One way is to declare it in the Android Manifest file. The manifest should specify an association between the Broadcast Receiver and an intent filter to indicate the actions the receiver is meant to listen for. \n An example Broadcast Receiver declaration with an intent filter in a manifest: \n &lt;receiver android:name= \".MyReceiver\" &gt; \n &lt;intent-filter&gt; \n &lt;action android:name= \"com.owasp.myapplication.MY_ACTION\" /&gt; \n &lt;/intent-filter&gt; \n &lt;/receiver&gt; \n \n Please note that in this example, the Broadcast Receiver does not include the android:exported attribute. As at least one filter was defined, the default value will be set to \"true\". In absence of any filters, it will be set to \"false\". \n The other way is to create the receiver dynamically in code. The receiver can then register with the method Context.registerReceiver. \n An example of registering a Broadcast Receiver dynamically: \n Example in Java: \n // Define a broadcast receiver \n BroadcastReceiver myReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver () { \n @Override \n public void onReceive ( Context context, Intent intent) { \n Log. d ( TAG, \"Intent received by myReceiver\"); \n} \n}; \n // Define an intent filter with actions that the broadcast receiver listens for \n IntentFilter intentFilter = new IntentFilter (); \n intentFilter. addAction ( \"com.owasp.myapplication.MY_ACTION\"); \n // To register the broadcast receiver \n registerReceiver ( myReceiver, intentFilter); \n // To un-register the broadcast receiver \n unregisterReceiver ( myReceiver); \n \n Example in Kotlin: \n // Define a broadcast receiver \n val myReceiver: BroadcastReceiver = object: BroadcastReceiver () { \n override fun onReceive ( context: Context, intent: Intent) { \n Log. d ( FragmentActivity. TAG, \"Intent received by myReceiver\") \n} \n} \n // Define an intent filter with actions that the broadcast receiver listens for \n val intentFilter = IntentFilter () \n intentFilter. addAction ( \"com.owasp.myapplication.MY_ACTION\") \n // To register the broadcast receiver \n registerReceiver ( myReceiver, intentFilter) \n // To un-register the broadcast receiver \n unregisterReceiver ( myReceiver) \n \n Note that the system starts an app with the registered receiver automatically when a relevant intent is raised. \n According to Broadcasts Overview, a broadcast is considered \"implicit\" if it does not target an app specifically. After receiving an implicit broadcast, Android will list all apps that have registered a given action in their filters. If more than one app has registered for the same action, Android will prompt the user to select from the list of available apps. \n An interesting feature of Broadcast Receivers is that they can be prioritized; this way, an intent will be delivered to all authorized receivers according to their priority. A priority can be assigned to an intent filter in the manifest via the android:priority attribute as well as programmatically via the IntentFilter.setPriority method. However, note that receivers with the same priority will be run in an arbitrary order. \n If your app is not supposed to send broadcasts across apps, use a Local Broadcast Manager ( LocalBroadcastManager). They can be used to make sure intents are received from the internal app only, and any intent from any other app will be discarded. This is very useful for improving security and the efficiency of the app, as no interprocess communication is involved. However, please note that the LocalBroadcastManager class is deprecated and Google recommends using alternatives such as LiveData. \n For more security considerations regarding Broadcast Receiver, see Security Considerations and Best Practices. \n Implicit Broadcast Receiver Limitation ¶ \n According to Background Optimizations, apps targeting Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher no longer receive CONNECTIVITY_ACTION broadcast unless they register their Broadcast Receivers with Context.registerReceiver(). The system does not send ACTION_NEW_PICTURE and ACTION_NEW_VIDEO broadcasts as well. \n According to Background Execution Limits, apps that target Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher can no longer register Broadcast Receivers for implicit broadcasts in their manifest, except for those listed in Implicit Broadcast Exceptions. The Broadcast Receivers created at runtime by calling Context.registerReceiver are not affected by this limitation. \n According to Changes to System Broadcasts, beginning with Android 9 (API level 28), the NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION broadcast doesn't receive information about the user's location or personally identifiable data. \n Android Application Publishing ¶ \n Once an app has been successfully developed, the next step is to publish and share it with others. However, apps can't simply be added to a store and shared, they must be first signed. The cryptographic signature serves as a verifiable mark placed by the developer of the app. It identifies the app's author and ensures that the app has not been modified since its initial distribution. \n Signing Process ¶ \n During development, apps are signed with an automatically generated certificate. This certificate is inherently insecure and is for debugging only. Most stores don't accept this kind of certificate for publishing; therefore, a certificate with more secure features must be created.\nWhen an application is installed on the Android device, the Package Manager ensures that it has been signed with the certificate included in the corresponding APK. If the certificate's public key matches the key used to sign any other APK on the device, the new APK may share a UID with the pre-existing APK. This facilitates interactions between applications from a single vendor. Alternatively, specifying security permissions for the Signature protection level is possible; this will restrict access to applications that have been signed with the same key. \n APK Signing Schemes ¶ \n Android supports multiple application signing schemes: \n \n Below Android 7.0 (API level 24): applications can only use the JAR signing (v1) scheme which does not protect all parts of the APK. This scheme is considered insecure. \n Android 7.0 (API level 24) and above: applications can use the v2 signature scheme, which signs the APK as a whole, providing stronger protection compared to the older v1 (JAR) signing method. \n Android 9 (API level 28) and above: It's recommended to use both the v2 and v3 signature schemes. The v3 scheme supports key rotation, enabling developers to replace keys in the event of a compromise without invalidating old signatures. \n Android 11 (API level 30) and above: applications can optionally include the v4 signature scheme to enable faster incremental updates. \n \n For backwards compatibility, an APK can be signed with multiple signature schemes in order to make the app run on both newer and older SDK versions. For example, older platforms ignore v2 signatures and verify v1 signatures only. \n JAR Signing (v1 Scheme) ¶ \n The original version of app signing implements the signed APK as a standard signed JAR, which must contain all the entries in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF. All files must be signed with a common certificate. This scheme does not protect some parts of the APK, such as ZIP metadata. The drawback of this scheme is that the APK verifier needs to process untrusted data structures before applying the signature, and the verifier discards data the data structures don't cover. Also, the APK verifier must decompress all compressed files, which takes considerable time and memory. \n This signature scheme is considered insecure, it is for example affected by the Janus vulnerability (CVE-2017-13156), which can allow malicious actors to modify APK files without invalidating the v1 signature. As such, v1 should never be relied on for devices running Android 7.0 and above. \n APK Signature Scheme (v2 Scheme) ¶ \n With the APK signature scheme, the complete APK is hashed and signed, and an APK Signing Block is created and inserted into the APK. During validation, the v2 scheme checks the signatures of the entire APK file. This form of APK verification is faster and offers more comprehensive protection against modification. You can see the APK signature verification process for v2 Scheme below. \n \n APK Signature Scheme (v3 Scheme) ¶ \n The v3 APK Signing Block format is the same as v2. V3 adds information about the supported SDK versions and a proof-of-rotation struct to the APK signing block. In Android 9 (API level 28) and higher, APKs can be verified according to APK Signature Scheme v3, v2 or v1 scheme. Older platforms ignore v3 signatures and try to verify v2 then v1 signature. \n The proof-of-rotation attribute in the signed-data of the signing block consists of a singly-linked list, with each node containing a signing certificate used to sign previous versions of the app. To make backward compatibility work, the old signing certificates sign the new set of certificates, thus providing each new key with evidence that it should be as trusted as the older key(s).\nIt is no longer possible to sign APKs independently, because the proof-of-rotation structure must have the old signing certificates signing the new set of certificates, rather than signing them one-by-one. You can see the APK signature v3 scheme verification process below. \n \n APK Signature Scheme (v4 Scheme) ¶ \n The APK Signature Scheme v4 was introduced along with Android 11 (API level 30) and requires all devices launched with Android 11 and up to have fs-verity enabled by default. fs-verity is a Linux kernel feature that is primarily used for file authentication (detection of malicious modifications) due to its extremely efficient file hash calculation. Read requests only will succeed if the content verifies against trusted digital certificates that were loaded to the kernel keyring during boot time. \n The v4 signature requires a complementary v2 or v3 signature and in contrast to previous signature schemes, the v4 signature is stored in a separate file &lt;apk name&gt;.apk.idsig. Remember to specify it using the --v4-signature-file flag when verifying a v4-signed APK with apksigner verify. \n You can find more detailed information in the Android developer documentation. \n Creating Your Certificate ¶ \n Android uses public/private certificates to sign Android apps (.apk files). Certificates are bundles of information; in terms of security, keys are the most important part of that bundle. Public certificates contain users' public keys, and private certificates contain users' private keys. Public and private certificates are linked. Certificates are unique and can't be re-generated. Note that if a certificate is lost, it cannot be recovered, so updating any apps signed with that certificate becomes impossible.\nApp creators can either reuse an existing private/public key pair that is in an available KeyStore or generate a new pair.\nIn the Android SDK, a new key pair is generated with the keytool command. The following command creates a RSA key pair with a key length of 2048 bits and an expiry time of 7300 days = 20 years. The generated key pair is stored in the file 'myKeyStore.jks', which is in the current directory: \n keytool -genkey -alias myDomain -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 7300 -keystore myKeyStore.jks -storepass myStrongPassword\n \n Safely storing your secret key and making sure it remains secret during its entire life cycle is of paramount importance. Anyone who gains access to the key will be able to publish updates to your apps with content that you don't control (thereby adding insecure features or accessing shared content with signature-based permissions). The trust that a user places in an app and its developers is based totally on such certificates; certificate protection and secure management are therefore vital for reputation and customer retention, and secret keys must never be shared with other individuals. Keys are stored in a binary file that can be protected with a password; such files are referred to as KeyStores. KeyStore passwords should be strong and known only to the key creator. For this reason, keys are usually stored on a dedicated build machine that developers have limited access to.\nAn Android certificate must have a validity period that's longer than that of the associated app (including updated versions of the app). For example, Google Play will require certificates to remain valid until Oct 22nd, 2033 at least. \n Signing an Application ¶ \n The goal of the signing process is to associate the app file (.apk) with the developer's public key. To achieve this, the developer calculates a hash of the APK file and encrypts it with their own private key. Third parties can then verify the app's authenticity (e.g., the fact that the app really comes from the user who claims to be the originator) by decrypting the encrypted hash with the author's public key and verifying that it matches the actual hash of the APK file. \n Many Integrated Development Environments (IDE) integrate the app signing process to make it easier for the user. Be aware that some IDEs store private keys in clear text in configuration files; double-check this in case others are able to access such files and remove the information if necessary.\nApps can be signed from the command line with the 'apksigner' tool provided by the Android SDK (API level 24 and higher). It is located at [SDK-Path]/build-tools/[version]. For API 24.0.2 and below, you can use 'jarsigner', which is part of the Java JDK. Details about the whole process can be found in official Android documentation; however, an example is given below to illustrate the point. \n apksigner sign --out mySignedApp.apk --ks myKeyStore.jks myUnsignedApp.apk\n \n In this example, an unsigned app ('myUnsignedApp.apk') will be signed with a private key from the developer KeyStore 'myKeyStore.jks' (located in the current directory). The app will become a signed app called 'mySignedApp.apk' and will be ready to release to stores. \n Zipalign ¶ \n The zipalign tool should always be used to align the APK file before distribution. This tool aligns all uncompressed data (such as images, raw files, and 4-byte boundaries) within the APK, which helps improve memory management during app runtime. \n \n Zipalign must be used before the APK file is signed with apksigner. \n \n Publishing Process ¶ \n Distributing apps from anywhere (your own site, any store, etc.) is possible because the Android ecosystem is open. However, Google Play is the most well-known, trusted, and popular store, and Google itself provides it. Amazon Appstore is the trusted default store for Kindle devices. If users want to install third-party apps from a non-trusted source, they must explicitly allow this with their device security settings. \n Apps can be installed on an Android device from a variety of sources: locally via USB, via Google's official app store (Google Play Store) or from alternative stores. \n Whereas other vendors may review and approve apps before they are actually published, Google will simply scan for known malware signatures; this minimizes the time between the beginning of the publishing process and public app availability. \n Publishing an app is quite straightforward; the main operation is making the signed APK file downloadable. On Google Play, publishing starts with account creation and is followed by app delivery through a dedicated interface. Details are available at the official Android documentation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Many large websites and services such as Google Maps, Twitter, Facebook, PayPal, etc. provide APIs allowing developers to make use of their data (e.g. displaying your twitter stream on your blog) or services (e.g. using Facebook login to log in your users). This article looks at the difference between browser APIs and 3rd party APIs and shows some typical uses of the latter.\n\n| Prerequisites: | Familiarity with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting), especially [JavaScript object basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Object_basics) and core API coverage such as [DOM scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/DOM_scripting) and [Network requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Network_requests). |\n| Learning outcomes: | - The concepts behind third-party APIs and associated patterns such as API keys. - Using a third-party map API. - Using a RESTful API. - Using Google's YouTube APIs. |\n\n## [What are third party APIs?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#what_are_third_party_apis)\n\nThird party APIs are APIs provided by third parties — generally companies such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google — to allow you to access their functionality via JavaScript and use it on your site. One of the most obvious examples is using mapping APIs to display custom maps on your pages.\n\nLet's look at a [Simple Mapquest API example](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/javascript/apis/third-party-apis/mapquest), and use it to illustrate how third-party APIs differ from browser APIs.\n\n### [They are found on third-party servers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#they_are_found_on_third-party_servers)\n\nBrowser APIs are built into the browser — you can access them from JavaScript immediately. For example, the Web Audio API we [saw in the Introductory article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Introduction#how_do_apis_work) is accessed using the native [`AudioContext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext) object. For example:\n\njs\n\n```\nconst audioCtx = new AudioContext();\n// …\nconst audioElement = document.querySelector(\"audio\");\n// …\nconst audioSource = audioCtx.createMediaElementSource(audioElement);\n// etc.\n\n```\n\nThird party APIs, on the other hand, are located on third party servers. To access them from JavaScript you first need to connect to the API functionality and make it available on your page. This typically involves first linking to a JavaScript library available on the server via a [` `](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) element, as seen in our Mapquest example:\n\nhtml\n\n```\n \n \n\n```\n\nYou can then start using the objects available in that library. For example:\n\njs\n\n```\nconst map = L.mapquest.map(\"map\", {\n center: [53.480759, -2.242631],\n layers: L.mapquest.tileLayer(\"map\"),\n zoom: 12,\n});\n\n```\n\nHere we are creating a variable to store the map information in, then creating a new map using the `mapquest.map()` method, which takes as its parameters the ID of a [` `](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) element you want to display the map in ('map'), and an options object containing the details of the particular map we want to display. In this case we specify the coordinates of the center of the map, a map layer of type `map` to show (created using the `mapquest.tileLayer()` method), and the default zoom level.\n\nThis is all the information the Mapquest API needs to plot a simple map. The server you are connecting to handles all the complicated stuff, like displaying the correct map tiles for the area being shown, etc.\n\n**Note:**\nSome APIs handle access to their functionality slightly differently, requiring the developer to make an HTTP request to a specific URL pattern to retrieve data. These are called [RESTful APIs — we'll show an example later on](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs#a_restful_api_%e2%80%94_nytimes).\n\n### [They usually require API keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#they_usually_require_api_keys)\n\nSecurity for browser APIs tends to be handled by permission prompts, as [discussed in our first article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Introduction#they_have_additional_security_mechanisms_where_appropriate). The purpose of these is so that the user knows what is going on in the websites they visit and is less likely to fall victim to someone using an API in a malicious way.\n\nThird party APIs have a slightly different permissions system — they tend to use developer keys to allow developers access to the API functionality, which is more to protect the API vendor than the user.\n\nYou'll find a line similar to the following in the Mapquest API example:\n\njs\n\n```\nL.mapquest.key = \"YOUR-API-KEY-HERE\";\n\n```\n\nThis line specifies an API or developer key to use in your application — the developer of the application must apply to get a key, and then include it in their code to be allowed access to the API's functionality. In our example we've just provided a placeholder.\n\n**Note:**\nWhen creating your own examples, you'll use your own API key in place of any placeholder.\n\nOther APIs may require that you include the key in a slightly different way, but the pattern is relatively similar for most of them.\n\nRequiring a key enables the API provider to hold users of the API accountable for their actions. When the developer has registered for a key, they are then known to the API provider, and action can be taken if they start to do anything malicious with the API (such as tracking people's location or trying to spam the API with loads of requests to stop it working, for example). The easiest action would be to just revoke their API privileges.\n\n## [Extending the Mapquest example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#extending_the_mapquest_example)\n\nLet's add some more functionality to the Mapquest example to show how to use some other features of the API.\n\n1. To start this section, make yourself a copy of the [mapquest starter file](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/third-party-apis/mapquest/start/index.html), in a new directory. If you've already cloned the [examples repository](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area), you'll already have a copy of this file, which you can find in the _javascript/apis/third-party-apis/mapquest/start_ directory.\n2. Next, you need to go to the [Mapquest developer site](https://developer.mapquest.com/), create an account, and then create a developer key to use with your example. (At the time of writing, it was called a \"consumer key\" on the site, and the key creation process also asked for an optional \"callback URL\". You don't need to fill in a URL here: just leave it blank.)\n3. Open up your starting file, and replace the API key placeholder with your key.\n\n### [Changing the type of map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#changing_the_type_of_map)\n\nThere are a number of different types of map that can be shown with the Mapquest API. To do this, find the following line:\n\njs\n\n```\nlayers: L.mapquest.tileLayer(\"map\");\n\n```\n\nTry changing `'map'` to `'hybrid'` to show a hybrid-style map. Try some other values too. The [`tileLayer` reference page](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/mapquest-js/v1.3/l-mapquest-tile-layer/) shows the different available options, plus a lot more information.\n\n### [Adding different controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#adding_different_controls)\n\nThe map has a number of different controls available; by default it just shows a zoom control. You can expand the controls available using the `map.addControl()` method; add this to your code:\n\njs\n\n```\nmap.addControl(L.mapquest.control());\n\n```\n\nThe [`mapquest.control()` method](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/mapquest-js/v1.3/l-mapquest-control/) just creates a simple full-featured control set, and it is placed in the top-right-hand corner by default. You can adjust the position by specifying an options object as a parameter for the control containing a `position` property, the value of which is a string specifying a position for the control. Try this, for example:\n\njs\n\n```\nmap.addControl(L.mapquest.control({ position: \"bottomright\" }));\n\n```\n\nThere are other types of control available, for example [`mapquest.searchControl()`](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/mapquest-js/v1.3/l-mapquest-search-control/) and [`mapquest.satelliteControl()`](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/mapquest-js/v1.3/l-mapquest-satellite-control/), and some are quite complex and powerful. Have a play around and see what you can come up with.\n\n### [Adding a custom marker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#adding_a_custom_marker)\n\nAdding a marker (icon) at a certain point on the map is easy — you just use the [`L.marker()`](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#marker) method (which seems to be documented in the related Leaflet.js docs). Add the following code to your example, again inside `window.onload`:\n\njs\n\n```\nL.marker([53.480759, -2.242631], {\n icon: L.mapquest.icons.marker({\n primaryColor: \"#22407F\",\n secondaryColor: \"#3B5998\",\n shadow: true,\n size: \"md\",\n symbol: \"A\",\n }),\n})\n .bindPopup(\"This is Manchester!\")\n .addTo(map);\n\n```\n\nAs you can see, this at its simplest takes two parameters, an array containing the coordinates at which to display the marker, and an options object containing an `icon` property that defines the icon to display at that point.\n\nThe icon is defined using an [`mapquest.icons.marker()`](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/mapquest-js/v1.3/l-mapquest-icons/) method, which as you can see contains information such as color and size of marker.\n\nOnto the end of the first method call we chain `.bindPopup('This is Manchester!')`, which defines content to display when the marker is clicked.\n\nFinally, we chain `.addTo(map)` to the end of the chain to actually add the marker to the map.\n\nHave a play with the other options shown in the documentation and see what you can come up with! Mapquest provides some pretty advanced functionality, such as directions, searching, etc.\n\n**Note:**\nIf you have trouble getting the example to work, check your code against our [finished version](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/third-party-apis/mapquest/finished/script.js).\n\n## [A RESTful API — NYTimes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#a_restful_api_%E2%80%94_nytimes)\n\nNow let's look at another API example — the [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/). This API allows you to retrieve New York Times news story information and display it on your site. This type of API is known as a **RESTful API** — instead of getting data using the features of a JavaScript library like we did with Mapquest, we get data by making HTTP requests to specific URLs, with data like search terms and other properties encoded in the URL (often as URL parameters). This is a common pattern you'll encounter with APIs.\n\nBelow we'll take you through an exercise to show you how to use the NYTimes API, which also provides a more general set of steps to follow that you can use as an approach for working with new APIs.\n\n### [Find the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#find_the_documentation)\n\nWhen you want to use a third party API, it is essential to find out where the documentation is, so you can find out what features the API has, how you use them, etc. The New York Times API documentation is at [https://developer.nytimes.com/](https://developer.nytimes.com/).\n\n### [Get a developer key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#get_a_developer_key)\n\nMost APIs require you to use some kind of developer key, for reasons of security and accountability. To sign up for an NYTimes API key, following the instructions at [https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started).\n\n1. Let's request a key for the Article Search API — create a new app, selecting this as the API you want to use (fill in a name and description, toggle the switch under the \"Article Search API\" to the on position, and then click \"Create\").\n2. Get the API key from the resulting page.\n3. Now, to start the example off, make a copy of all the files in the [nytimes/start](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/javascript/apis/third-party-apis/nytimes/start) directory. If you've already cloned the [examples repository](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area), you'll already have a copy of these files, which you can find in the _javascript/apis/third-party-apis/nytimes/start_ directory. Initially the `script.js` file contains a number of variables needed for the setup of the example; below we'll fill in the required functionality.\n\nThe app will end up allowing you to type in a search term and optional start and end dates, which it will then use to query the Article Search API and display the search results.\n\n![A screenshot of a sample search query and search results as retrieved from the New York Article Search API.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs/nytimes-example.png)\n\n### [Connect the API to your app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#connect_the_api_to_your_app)\n\nFirst, you'll need to make a connection between the API and your app. In the case of this API, you need to include the API key as a [get](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) parameter every time you request data from the service at the correct URL.\n\n1. Find the following line:\n\n\n\njs\n\n\n\n```\nconst key = \"INSERT-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE\";\n\n```\n\n\n\nReplace the existing API key with the actual API key you got in the previous section.\n\n2. Add the following line to your JavaScript, below the `// Event listeners to control the functionality` comment. This runs a function called `submitSearch()` when the form is submitted (the button is pressed).\n\n\n\njs\n\n\n\n```\nsearchForm.addEventListener(\"submit\", submitSearch);\n\n```\n\n3. Now add the `submitSearch()` and `fetchResults()` function definitions, below the previous line:\n\n\n\njs\n\n\n\n```\nfunction submitSearch(e) {\n pageNumber = 0;\n fetchResults(e);\n}\n\nfunction fetchResults(e) {\n // Use preventDefault() to stop the form submitting\n e.preventDefault();\n\n // Assemble the full URL\n let url = `${baseURL}?api-key=${key}&page=${pageNumber}&q=${searchTerm.value}&fq=document_type:(\"article\")`;\n\n if (startDate.value !== \"\") {\n url = `${url}&begin_date=${startDate.value}`;\n }\n\n if (endDate.value !== \"\") {\n url = `${url}&end_date=${endDate.value}`;\n }\n}\n\n```\n\n\n`submitSearch()` sets the page number back to 0 to begin with, then calls `fetchResults()`. This first calls [`preventDefault()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) on the event object, to stop the form actually submitting (which would break the example). Next, we use some string manipulation to assemble the full URL that we will make the request to. We start off by assembling the parts we deem as mandatory for this demo:\n\n- The base URL (taken from the `baseURL` variable).\n- The API key, which has to be specified in the `api-key` URL parameter (the value is taken from the `key` variable).\n- The page number, which has to be specified in the `page` URL parameter (the value is taken from the `pageNumber` variable).\n- The search term, which has to be specified in the `q` URL parameter (the value is taken from the value of the `searchTerm` text [` `](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)).\n- The document type to return results for, as specified in an expression passed in via the `fq` URL parameter. In this case, we want to return articles.\n\nNext, we use a couple of [`if ()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) statements to check whether the `startDate` and `endDate` elements have had values filled in on them. If they do, we append their values to the URL, specified in `begin_date` and `end_date` URL parameters respectively.\n\nSo, a complete URL would end up looking something like this:\n\nurl\n\n```\nhttps://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?api-key=YOUR-API-KEY-HERE&page=0&q=cats&fq=document_type:(\"article\")&begin_date=20170301&end_date=20170312\n\n```\n\n**Note:**\nYou can find more details of what URL parameters can be included at the [NYTimes developer docs](https://developer.nytimes.com/).\n\n**Note:**\nThe example has rudimentary form data validation — the search term field has to be filled in before the form can be submitted (achieved using the `required` attribute), and the date fields have `pattern` attributes specified, which means they won't submit unless their values consist of 8 numbers ( `pattern=\"[0-9]{8}\"`). See [Form data validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation) for more details on how these work.\n\n### [Requesting data from the API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#requesting_data_from_the_api)\n\nNow we've constructed our URL, let's make a request to it. We'll do this using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).\n\nAdd the following code block inside the `fetchResults()` function, just above the closing curly brace:\n\njs\n\n```\n// Use fetch() to make the request to the API\nfetch(url)\n .then((response) => response.json())\n .then((json) => displayResults(json))\n .catch((error) => console.error(`Error fetching data: ${error.message}`));\n\n```\n\nHere we run the request by passing our `url` variable to [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch), convert the response body to JSON using the [`json()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json) function, then pass the resulting JSON to the `displayResults()` function so the data can be displayed in our UI. We also catch and log any errors that might be thrown.\n\n### [Displaying the data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#displaying_the_data)\n\nOK, let's look at how we'll display the data. Add the following function below your `fetchResults()` function.\n\njs\n\n```\nfunction displayResults(json) {\n while (section.firstChild) {\n section.removeChild(section.firstChild);\n }\n\n const articles = json.response.docs;\n\n nav.style.display = articles.length === 10 ? \"block\" : \"none\";\n\n if (articles.length === 0) {\n const para = document.createElement(\"p\");\n para.textContent = \"No results returned.\";\n section.appendChild(para);\n } else {\n for (const current of articles) {\n const article = document.createElement(\"article\");\n const heading = document.createElement(\"h2\");\n const link = document.createElement(\"a\");\n const img = document.createElement(\"img\");\n const para1 = document.createElement(\"p\");\n const keywordPara = document.createElement(\"p\");\n keywordPara.classList.add(\"keywords\");\n\n console.log(current);\n\n link.href = current.web_url;\n link.textContent = current.headline.main;\n para1.textContent = current.snippet;\n keywordPara.textContent = \"Keywords: \";\n for (const keyword of current.keywords) {\n const span = document.createElement(\"span\");\n span.textContent = `${keyword.value} `;\n keywordPara.appendChild(span);\n }\n\n if (current.multimedia.length > 0) {\n img.src = `http://www.nytimes.com/${current.multimedia[0].url}`;\n img.alt = current.headline.main;\n }\n\n article.appendChild(heading);\n heading.appendChild(link);\n article.appendChild(img);\n article.appendChild(para1);\n article.appendChild(keywordPara);\n section.appendChild(article);\n }\n }\n}\n\n```\n\nThere's a lot of code here; let's explain it step by step:\n\n- The [`while`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while) loop is a common pattern used to delete all of the contents of a DOM element, in this case, the [` `](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section) element. We keep checking to see if the ` ` has a first child, and if it does, we remove the first child. The loop ends when ` ` no longer has any children.\n\n- Next, we set the `articles` variable to equal `json.response.docs` — this is the array holding all the objects that represent the articles returned by the search. This is done purely to make the following code a bit simpler.\n\n- The first [`if ()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) block checks to see if 10 articles are returned (the API returns up to 10 articles at a time.) If so, we display the [` `](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav) that contains the _Previous 10_/ _Next 10_ pagination buttons. If fewer than 10 articles are returned, they will all fit on one page, so we don't need to show the pagination buttons. We will wire up the pagination functionality in the next section.\n\n- The next `if ()` block checks to see if no articles are returned. If so, we don't try to display any — we create a [` `](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) containing the text \"No results returned.\" and insert it into the ` `.\n\n- If some articles are returned, we, first of all, create all the elements that we want to use to display each news story, insert the right contents into each one, and then insert them into the DOM at the appropriate places. To work out which properties in the article objects contained the right data to show, we consulted the Article Search API reference (see [NYTimes APIs](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis)). Most of these operations are fairly obvious, but a few are worth calling out:\n\n - We used a [`for...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loop to go through all the keywords associated with each article, and insert each one inside its own [` `](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span), inside a ` `. This was done to make it easy to style each one.\n - We used an `if ()` block ( `if (current.multimedia.length > 0) { }`) to check whether each article has any images associated with it, as some stories don't. We display the first image only if it exists; otherwise, an error would be thrown.\n\n### [Wiring up the pagination buttons](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#wiring_up_the_pagination_buttons)\n\nTo make the pagination buttons work, we will increment (or decrement) the value of the `pageNumber` variable, and then re-rerun the fetch request with the new value included in the page URL parameter. This works because the NYTimes API only returns 10 results at a time — if more than 10 results are available, it will return the first 10 (0-9) if the `page` URL parameter is set to 0 (or not included at all — 0 is the default value), the next 10 (10-19) if it is set to 1, and so on.\n\nThis allows us to write a simplistic pagination function.\n\n1. Below the existing [`addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) call, add these two new ones, which cause the `nextPage()` and `previousPage()` functions to be invoked when the relevant buttons are clicked:\n\n\n\njs\n\n\n\n```\nnextBtn.addEventListener(\"click\", nextPage);\npreviousBtn.addEventListener(\"click\", previousPage);\n\n```\n\n2. Below your previous addition, let's define the two functions — add this code now:\n\n\n\njs\n\n\n\n```\nfunction nextPage(e) {\n pageNumber++;\n fetchResults(e);\n}\n\nfunction previousPage(e) {\n if (pageNumber > 0) {\n pageNumber--;\n } else {\n return;\n }\n fetchResults(e);\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\nThe first function increments the `pageNumber` variable, then run the `fetchResults()` function again to display the next page's results.\n\nThe second function works nearly exactly the same way in reverse, but we also have to take the extra step of checking that `pageNumber` is not already zero before decrementing it — if the fetch request runs with a minus `page` URL parameter, it could cause errors. If the `pageNumber` is already 0, we [`return`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return) out of the function — if we are already at the first page, we don't need to load the same results again.\n\n\n**Note:**\nYou can find our [finished NYTimes API example code on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/apis/third-party-apis/nytimes/finished/index.html) (also [see it running live here](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/apis/third-party-apis/nytimes/finished/)).\n\n## [YouTube example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#youtube_example)\n\nWe also built another example for you to study and learn from — see our [YouTube video search example](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/apis/third-party-apis/youtube/). This uses two related APIs:\n\n- The [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/) to search for YouTube videos and return results.\n- The [YouTube IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) to display the returned video examples inside IFrame video players so you can watch them.\n\nThis example is interesting because it shows two related third-party APIs being used together to build an app. The first one is a RESTful API, while the second one works more like Mapquest (with API-specific methods, etc.). It is worth noting however that both of the APIs require a JavaScript library to be applied to the page. The RESTful API has functions available to handle making the HTTP requests and returning the results.\n\n![A screenshot of a sample YouTube video search using two related APIs. The left side of the image has a sample search query using the YouTube Data API. The right side of the image displays the search results using the YouTube Iframe Player API.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs/youtube-example.png)\n\nWe are not going to say too much more about this example in the article — [the source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/main/javascript/apis/third-party-apis/youtube) has detailed comments inserted inside it to explain how it works.\n\nTo get it running, you'll need to:\n\n- Read the [YouTube Data API Overview](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) documentation.\n- Make sure you visit the [Enabled APIs page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enabled), and in the list of APIs, make sure the status is ON for the YouTube Data API v3.\n- Get an API key from [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).\n- Find the string `ENTER-API-KEY-HERE` in the source code, and replace it with your API key.\n- Run the example through a web server. It won't work if you just run it directly in the browser (i.e. via a `file://` URL).\n\n## [Summary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Third_party_APIs\\#summary)\n\nThis article has given you a useful introduction to using third-party APIs to add functionality to your websites.\n\n- [Previous](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs/Client-side_storage)\n- [Overview: Client-side web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Client-side_APIs)",

It is a more powerful and flexible replacement for [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n## [Concepts and usage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API\\#concepts_and_usage)\n\nThe Fetch API uses [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects (and other things involved with network requests), as well as related concepts such as CORS and the HTTP Origin header semantics.\n\nFor making a request and fetching a resource, use the [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) method. It is a global method in both [`Window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) and [`Worker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope) contexts. This makes it available in pretty much any context you might want to fetch resources in.\n\nThe `fetch()` method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that resolves to the [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) to that request — as soon as the server responds with headers — **even if the server response is an HTTP error status**. You can also optionally pass in an `init` options object as the second argument (see [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)).\n\nOnce a [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) is retrieved, there are a number of methods available to define what the body content is and how it should be handled.\n\nYou can create a request and response directly using the [`Request()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/Request) and [`Response()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response) constructors, but it's uncommon to do this directly.

                    "text": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In this chapter, we'll dive into setting up a security testing environment and introduce you to some practical processes and techniques for testing the security of Android apps. These are the building blocks for the MASTG test cases. \n Android Testing Setup ¶ \n You can set up a fully functioning test environment on almost any machine running Windows, Linux, or macOS. \n Host Device ¶ \n At the very least, you'll need Android Studio (which comes with the Android SDK) platform tools, an emulator, and an app to manage the various SDK versions and framework components. Android Studio also comes with an Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager application for creating emulator images. Make sure that the newest SDK tools and platform tools packages are installed on your system. \n In addition, you may want to complete your host setup by installing the Android NDK if you're planning to work with apps containing native libraries. \n Sometimes it can be useful to display or control devices from the computer. To achieve this, you can use Scrcpy. \n Testing Device ¶ \n For dynamic analysis, you'll need an Android device to run the target app on. In principle, you can test without a real Android device and use only the emulator. However, apps execute quite slowly on a emulator, and simulators may not give realistic results. Testing on a real device makes for a smoother process and a more realistic environment. On the other hand, emulators allow you to easily change SDK versions or create multiple devices. A full overview of the pros and cons of each approach is listed in the table below. \n \n \n \n Property \n Physical \n Emulator/Simulator \n \n \n \n \n Ability to restore \n Softbricks are always possible, but new firmware can typically still be flashed. Hardbricks are very rare. \n Emulators can crash or become corrupt, but a new one can be created or a snapshot can be restored. \n \n \n Reset \n Can be restored to factory settings or reflashed. \n Emulators can be deleted and recreated. \n \n \n Snapshots \n Not possible. \n Supported, great for malware analysis. \n \n \n Speed \n Much faster than emulators. \n Typically slow, but improvements are being made. \n \n \n Cost \n Typically start at $200 for a usable device. You may require different devices, such as one with or without a biometric sensor. \n Both free and commercial solutions exist. \n \n \n Ease of rooting \n Highly dependent on the device. \n Typically rooted by default. \n \n \n Ease of emulator detection \n It's not an emulator, so emulator checks are not applicable. \n Many artefacts will exist, making it easy to detect that the app is running in an emulator. \n \n \n Ease of root detection \n Easier to hide root, as many root detection algorithms check for emulator properties. With Magisk Systemless root it's nearly impossible to detect. \n Emulators will almost always trigger root detection algorithms due to the fact that they are built for testing with many artefacts that can be found. \n \n \n Hardware interaction \n Easy interaction through Bluetooth, NFC, 4G, Wi-Fi, biometrics, camera, GPS, gyroscope, ... \n Usually fairly limited, with emulated hardware input (e.g. random GPS coordinates) \n \n \n API level support \n Depends on the device and the community. Active communities will keep distributing updated versions (e.g. LineageOS), while less popular devices may only receive a few updates. Switching between versions requires flashing the device, a tedious process. \n Always supports the latest versions, including beta releases. Emulators containing specific API levels can easily be downloaded and launched. \n \n \n Native library support \n Native libraries are usually built for ARM devices, so they will work on a physical device. \n Some emulators run on x86 CPUs, so they may not be able to run packaged native libraries. \n \n \n Malware danger \n Malware samples can infect a device, but if you can clear out the device storage and flash a clean firmware, thereby restoring it to factory settings, this should not be a problem. Be aware that there are malware samples that try to exploit the USB bridge. \n Malware samples can infect an emulator, but the emulator can simply be removed and recreated. It is also possible to create snapshots and compare different snapshots to help in malware analysis. Be aware that there are malware proofs of concept which try to attack the hypervisor. \n \n \n \n Testing on a Real Device ¶ \n Almost any physical device can be used for testing, but there are a few considerations to be made. First, the device needs to be rootable. This is typically either done through an exploit, or through an unlocked bootloader. Exploits are not always available, and the bootloader may be locked permanently, or it may only be unlocked once the carrier contract has been terminated. \n The best candidates are flagship Google pixel devices built for developers. These devices typically come with an unlockable bootloader, opensource firmware, kernel, radio available online and official OS source code. The developer communities prefer Google devices as the OS is closest to the android open source project. These devices generally have the longest support windows with 2 years of OS updates and 1 year of security updates after that. \n Alternatively, Google's Android One project contains devices that will receive the same support windows (2 years of OS updates, 1 year of security updates) and have near-stock experiences. While it was originally started as a project for low-end devices, the program has evolved to include mid-range and high-end smartphones, many of which are actively supported by the modding community. \n Devices that are supported by the LineageOS project are also very good candidates for test devices. They have an active community, easy to follow flashing and rooting instructions and the latest Android versions are typically quickly available as a Lineage installation. LineageOS also continues support for new Android versions long after the OEM has stopped distributing updates. \n When working with an Android physical device, you'll want to enable Developer Mode and USB debugging on the device in order to use the adb debugging interface. Since Android 4.2 (API level 16), the Developer options sub menu in the Settings app is hidden by default. To activate it, tap the Build number section of the About phone view seven times. Note that the build number field's location varies slightly by device. For example, on LG Phones, it is under About phone -&gt; Software information. Once you have done this, Developer options will be shown at bottom of the Settings menu. Once developer options are activated, you can enable debugging with the USB debugging switch. \n Testing on an Emulator ¶ \n Multiple emulators exist, once again with their own strengths and weaknesses: \n Free emulators: \n \n Android Virtual Device (AVD) - The official android emulator, distributed with Android Studio. \n Android X86 - An x86 port of the Android code base \n \n Commercial emulators: \n \n Genymotion - Mature emulator with many features, both as local and cloud-based solution. Free version available for non-commercial use. \n Corellium - Offers custom device virtualization through a cloud-based or on-prem solution. \n \n Although there exist several free Android emulators, we recommend using AVD as it provides enhanced features appropriate for testing your app compared to the others. In the remainder of this guide, we will use the official AVD to perform tests. \n AVD supports some hardware emulation, such as GPS or SMS through its so-called Extended Controls as well as motion sensors. \n You can either start an Android Virtual Device (AVD) by using the AVD Manager in Android Studio or start the AVD manager from the command line with the android command, which is found in the tools directory of the Android SDK: \n Several tools and VMs that can be used to test an app within an emulator environment are available: \n \n MobSF \n Nathan (not updated since 2016) \n \n Getting Privileged Access ¶ \n Rooting (i.e., modifying the OS so that you can run commands as the root user) is recommended for testing on a real device. This gives you full control over the operating system and allows you to bypass restrictions such as app sandboxing. These privileges in turn allow you to use techniques like code injection and function hooking more easily. \n Note that rooting is risky, and three main consequences need to be clarified before you proceed. Rooting can have the following negative effects: \n \n voiding the device warranty (always check the manufacturer's policy before taking any action) \n \"bricking\" the device, i.e., rendering it inoperable and unusable \n creating additional security risks (because built-in exploit mitigations are often removed) \n \n You should not root a personal device that you store your private information on. We recommend getting a cheap, dedicated test device instead. Many older devices, such as Google's Nexus series, can run the newest Android versions and are perfectly fine for testing. \n You need to understand that rooting your device is ultimately YOUR decision and that OWASP shall in no way be held responsible for any damage. If you're uncertain, seek expert advice before starting the rooting process. \n Which Mobiles Can Be Rooted ¶ \n Virtually any Android mobile can be rooted. Commercial versions of Android OS (which are Linux OS evolutions at the kernel level) are optimized for the mobile world. Some features have been removed or disabled for these versions, for example, non-privileged users' ability to become the 'root' user (who has elevated privileges). Rooting a phone means allowing users to become the root user, e.g., adding a standard Linux executable called su, which is used to change to another user account. \n To root a mobile device, first unlock its boot loader. The unlocking procedure depends on the device manufacturer. However, for practical reasons, rooting some mobile devices is more popular than rooting others, particularly when it comes to security testing: devices created by Google and manufactured by companies like Samsung, LG, and Motorola are among the most popular, particularly because they are used by many developers. The device warranty is not nullified when the boot loader is unlocked and Google provides many tools to support the root itself. \n Rooting with Magisk ¶ \n Magisk (\"Magic Mask\") is one way to root your Android device. Its specialty lies in the way the modifications on the system are performed. While other rooting tools alter the actual data on the system partition, Magisk does not (which is called \"systemless\"). This enables a way to hide the modifications from root-sensitive applications (e.g. for banking or games) and allows using the official Android OTA upgrades without the need to unroot the device beforehand. \n You can get familiar with Magisk reading the official documentation on GitHub. If you don't have Magisk installed, you can find installation instructions in the documentation. If you use an official Android version and plan to upgrade it, Magisk provides a tutorial on GitHub. \n Furthermore, developers can use the power of Magisk to create custom modules and submit them to the official Magisk Modules repository. Submitted modules can then be installed inside the Magisk Manager application. One of these installable modules is a systemless version of Xposed (available for SDK versions up to 27). \n Root Detection ¶ \n An extensive list of root detection methods is presented in the \"Testing Anti-Reversing Defenses on Android\" chapter. \n For a typical mobile app security build, you'll usually want to test a debug build with root detection disabled. If such a build is not available for testing, you can disable root detection in a variety of ways that will be introduced later in this book. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

                    "text": "\n \n \n A software development kit (SDK) is a set of platform-specific building tools for developers. You require components like debuggers, compilers, and libraries to create code that runs on a specific platform, operating system, or programming language. SDKs put everything you need to develop and run software in one place. Additionally, they contain resources like documentation, tutorials, and guides as well as APIs and frameworks for faster application development. \n \n \n What are the benefits of an SDK? \n \n SDKs offer several benefits across the development process that help developers create applications. They include: \n Efficient development \n SDKs make development more efficient by providing pre-built components and libraries that can be incorporated into applications. These components save developers significant time previously taken on coding and debugging from scratch.  \n Faster deployment \n SDKs enable faster deployment by providing tools that let developers build and integrate applications quickly. They often support multiple platforms, allowing developers to deploy across multiple devices or operating systems rapidly. \n Integration \n SDKs provide pre-built modules, components, packages, and tools for developers to build, test, and deploy software applications. They simplify developing, testing, and integration with other systems and services, code samples and tutorials, debugging tools, and code libraries.  \n \n Cost savings \n SDKs reduce the time and resources needed to develop applications. By providing a library of pre-built components and tools, SDKs enable developers to quickly build out features and functionality. SDKs reduce the time and costs required to create new applications. They also reduce costs associated with deploying and maintaining applications, providing simplified installation processes and updates. \n \n \n \n What are some uses of an SDK? \n \n There are several uses for SDKs, including the following: \n Mobile app development \n SDKs provide developers with tools, libraries, and other resources to develop mobile apps. They include components to debug, monitor, and optimize mobile application performance. Developers can build UI elements, access data, and integrate with third-party services. SDKs also make it simpler to deploy apps across different platforms, such as iOS or Android.  \n Web development \n SDKs provide developers with the tools they need to build the front end of web apps, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back end resources like databases, server-side programming languages, frameworks, and APIs. SDKs also provide deployment tools for hosting and scaling. \n Cloud computing \n SDKs provide APIs and libraries to connect to cloud storage services, or to access cloud computing services such as databases, analytics, or machine learning. Developers use them to integrate with a cloud environment in their preferred language of choice. \n Internet of Things (IoT) \n Developers use SDKs to create IoT applications that interact with sensors, allowing them to create applications that can monitor, collect, and analyze data from the environment. Additionally, you can manage device firmware and software updates more efficiently, as SDKs often provide updates and security patches. \n Game development \n Gaming SDKs often come with sample code, tutorials, and other resources to help developers create games. 3D graphics libraries, audio libraries, physics engines, artificial intelligence libraries, networking libraries, and development tools are all standard gaming components. \n \n \n \n Various software development tools and building blocks are commonly found in software development kits. These include: \n API libraries \n Application programming interface (API) libraries are collections of code written in a particular programming language, such as Java, C#, or Python. You use APIs to access specific features, software applications, or operating systems like iOS or Android.   \n Debuggers \n Debuggers locate and correct errors in software code, providing real-time access to the internals of software programs. Standard debugging features include setting breakpoints to pause the program, inspecting the values of variables, and checking code line by line. \n Compilers and interpreters \n Compilers and interpreters convert code written in a programming language into machine-readable code. Compilers generate executable programs, while interpreters directly run programs. \n Profilers \n Profilers analyze application performance, including memory usage, execution times, and code execution paths. By collecting and analyzing data, profilers help identify areas of a program where optimizations can be made or where issues could happen.  \n Code samples \n Code samples are pieces of example code that developers use to understand and implement specific concepts or features. Code samples show how to use the SDK components like libraries and APIs to build applications.  \n Deployment tools \n Deployment tools enable development teams to deploy their applications to the target platform. This can involve configuring applications for the relevant platform and packaging applications. Examples of deployment tools include installers, automation tools, and deployment wizards. \n Integrated development environment (IDE) \n An IDE brings together essential tools developers use to write and test software and debug code. An IDE typically includes a code editor, a compiler, a debugger, a project manager, and a version control system. \n \n \n How does an SDK work? \n \n Using an SDK usually follows three steps:  \n \n Purchasing or downloading then installing a platform-specific SDK. \n Using the SDK to develop your application within an integrated development environment. \n Utilizing the instructions, documentation, code samples, and testing tools included in the SDK for efficient development. \n \n Difference between SDK and API \n APIs are a set of programming instructions that enable applications to communicate with each other. APIs provide a way for applications to access and share data, usually through a series of requests and responses. For example, a web API might enable a user to search for a product on a website, and the API will provide the relevant information in response. Developers use APIs to integrate their applications with third-party services, such as social media networks or payment processors. APIs are a communication bridge between two applications. SDKs, on the other hand, bring third-party tools to the developer’s environment.  \n What should be considered when choosing an SDK? \n The SDK you choose should be optimized for your specific use case, not slow down your application, and provide the necessary security measures to protect your users’ data. Some considerations include: \n License agreement \n It is important to check the SDK’s license agreement to make sure it covers all necessary uses. It must be legally compliant, and there should be no restrictions on use or distribution of the applications you develop. It is essential to understand the limitations of any open-source licenses that may be associated with the SDK. \n Security \n You have to ensure that your SDK comes from authorized sources and does not contain any malicious or harmful code. The SDK you use should be appropriately documented, supported, and updated regularly to ensure security.  \n Compatibility \n When deciding which SDK to use, it is vital to ensure compatibility with your application’s deployment infrastructure. For example, the SDK should be compatible with the operating systems of all devices you plan to support. It should also support the language your app is written in and provide a way to integrate with other languages. \n \n \n \n What SDKs does AWS provide? \n \n AWS provides SDKs for many popular technologies and programming languages. They make it easier for you to call AWS services from within your applications in that language or technology. Additionally, AWS also offers SDKs for AWS SaaS offerings so you can use them more efficiently in your code. Some examples include: \n \n AWS SDK for .NET provides simplified AWS Services through a set of libraries that are consistent and familiar to .NET developers.  \n AWS SDK for Python   integrates Python applications, libraries, or scripts with AWS services. \n AWS SDK for Ruby eliminates programming intricacies by providing Ruby classes for many AWS services. \n AWS SDK for Rust simplifies the use of AWS services by providing a set of consistent and familiar libraries to Rust developers. \n AWS WorkDocs SDK removes the complexity of building file collaboration and management capabilities into your solutions and applications, providing full administrator and user-level access to Amazon WorkDocs site resources.  \n Amazon Chime SDK allows developers to add real-time voice, video, and messaging powered by machine learning into their applications. \n \n Begin your free AWS trial to start using the correct AWS SDK for your business. \n \n \n",

You typically don’t try to implement things like sorting etc. from scratch when you go to solve a problem. You either using something built into the language (the “standard library”) or you pull down some code that someone else wrote (“third party library”).\n\nImagine you’re building a house. Would it make sense to try and build every single thing from scratch (like trees and raw ore?!), or maybe buy some precut lumber, some pipes, and follow someone’s “how to build a house” tutorial on YouTube?\n\nThese standard and 3rd party libraries are analogous to the prebuilt pieces you would use to assemble your house. You _could_ build a house from scratch, but it would probably resemble a shack/ not be up to any sort of code that a home inspector would pass.\n\nNow, let’s up the ante. Instead of a third party library or a standard library, what if you wanted some way to build homes that just involved customizing a few bits and pieces. Essentially most of the house would already have been built, but you could decide where to put it, what sort of furnishings it had, etc. This might sound like a fantasy to you, but [Sears actually sold these sorts of homes](http://www.searsarchives.com/homes/index.htm), back when they were a thing (RIP Sears). You’d essentially buy a “Modern Home” and have all of the pieces shipped to you. And then it was up to you to make something.\n\nSDKs, or Software Development Kits, are essentially the Sears Modern Homes of the software world. They come with all sorts of goodies for how to talk to existing systems, so that you can build software way faster than if you had to build your house from pre-assembled parts, but still figure out how to do the “architecting” of a house. Your job with SDKs is just to plug in what specific behavior/ features you want into a predefined ecosystem.\n\nTo see it another way, if we were building with Legos, you might think of standard libraries and third party libraries as prebuilt structures you could reuse, like a wing or a wheel, but you might think of an SDK as a whole set of prebuilt or mostly built structures; a whole ecosystem of Lego buildings that you could fit together as you want or sprinkle a little bit of your own creativity into to make something new.\n\nLet’s step away from these analogies and consider some of the more popular SDKs.\n\n# Examples of SDKs\n\n## Mobile SDKs\n\nThe most popular SDKs in terms of usage by developers are probably the Android and iOS SDKs. When it comes to building an application, Alphabet/Google and Apple are very incentivized to make it easy for developers to make new applications (partly because it drives the sales of their physical phones, but also because they take a [~30% cut](https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google)). To make things easier, they offer SDKs to do so.\n\nThe Android SDK is a bit more open sourced, in that you can develop on any device (Mac/Windows/Linux) using a development tool called [**Android Studio**](https://developer.android.com/studio) **.** Android Studio itself is an IDE that You can also develop using other tools, but Android Studio is the main way developers interact with the Android SDK. What does the SDK give you? The ability to compile, publish, run and test Android applications with very little of your own code. All you need to define is what your app _looks like_ and _does_.\n\nThe biggest departure for the iOS SDK is that it is more closed source, in that the only legitimate way to develop iOS applications is using a (yeah you can probably guess) Mac computer. Developing on Windows and Linux machines is not allowed, unless you do something tricky with a VM to run MacOS (which is like saying “you can develop on any machine you want, as long as it can run MacOS”). The iOS SDK is primarily interacted with via [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), a Mac only IDE that parallels Android Studio, though there are [alternatives](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/).\n\nBut what both of these SDKs have in common is that they make it possible for developers to quickly create and release apps to a marketplace that millions of folks can access. Without tools like this being available to developers, we wouldn’t have the mobile app ecosystem that we do today.\n\n## IntelliJ Plugin SDK\n\nAs part of the Mobile SDKs we mentioned IDEs, or Integrated Development Environments, essentially places that developers write code (like VSCode, or for this example, IntelliJ). IntelliJ is probably the most widely used Java IDE, eclipsing _Eclipse_, the IDE that formerly held the mantle of “most widely used Java IDE.” All the places I’ve worked that do Java development end up using IntelliJ.\n\nWhat is interesting about it is that not only is it a powerful Java IDE, but it is pretty well extensible. You can write your own [plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/welcome.html) to make it easier for developers to read/write/compile/run/test their code. You could add support for a [different software language](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala), change the syntax highlighting to [use rainbows](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10080-rainbow-brackets) to help with readability, or any other thing you can think of that you’d like your IDE to do ( [maybe a different progress bar](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8575-nyan-progress-bar)?). Just like mobile apps, these plugins have a marketplace you can push to and download apps from, all with the help of the SDK.\n\n# Specialty SDKs, \\_DKs\n\n## JDK -> Java Development Kit\n\nI mentioned Java as part of the IntelliJ Plugin SDK, but Java is a relatively complex ecosystem. There’s support for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on every machine type it can run on (Mac/Windows/Linux), there’s all sorts of different versions and slightly different tuning you can give to the JVM, and of course, there’s stupid licensing issues (yay Oracle). All of this leads to the fact that developing Java means choosing [a version and a kind](https://whichjdk.com/) of the _JDK_, the Java Development Kit. Amazon has their own, Oracle owns the “proprietary” one, and there’s an open source version (OpenJDK and now Adoptium).\n\nWhat is important to note is that the later versions have newer language features that might not be present in older versions. And you might not be able to ship or build software with the closed sourced versions without getting into financial trouble. But if you ever do Java development, you’ll have to have one of these JDKs installed and configured on your development machine. Most of the time the open source solution will be the right choice, but read up on what the others are and why they exist if you’re interested.\n\n## CDKs -> Cloud Development Kit\n\nThe last specialty SDK is one that allows you integrate with a cloud provider. Instead of something more low level like an application that folks can download, or what version/ type of Java people are running, this SDK is for how you provision and control cloud resources.\n\nThe most famous example of this is probably the [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html). They have support for the most common languages, but doing something like creating an s3 bucket looks like so:\n\n```\nbucket = s3.Bucket(\"MyBucket\", bucket_name=\"my-bucket\", versioned=True,\n website_redirect=s3.RedirectTarget(host_name=\"aws.amazon.com\"))\n```\n\nGranted, there are alternatives to these CDKs, like using something like Terraform (which is written with [jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/), blegh), but even [Terraform has a CDK](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cdktf/cdktf-build) so you can write code in a language of your (limited) choice instead of the standard (blegh) way you’d write Terraform.\n\nIn closing; SDKs are the prebuilt interfaces and tools that you can use to make applications and systems quickly with as little code as possible.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n[Sdk](https://medium.com/tag/sdk?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[Software Development Kit](https://medium.com/tag/software-development-kit?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[Explain Like Im 5](https://medium.com/tag/explain-like-im-5?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[Mobile App Development](https://medium.com/tag/mobile-app-development?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[![Matt Kornfield](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*YRQ1SmMdat7LtjkhFapUJw.png)](https://mckornfield.medium.com/?source=post_page---post_author_info--d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[![Matt Kornfield](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*YRQ1SmMdat7LtjkhFapUJw.png)](https://mckornfield.medium.com/?source=post_page---post_author_info--d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\nFollow\n\n[**Written by Matt Kornfield**](https://mckornfield.medium.com/?source=post_page---post_author_info--d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[584 Followers](https://mckornfield.medium.com/followers?source=post_page---post_author_info--d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n· [17 Following](https://mckornfield.medium.com/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\nToday's solutions are tomorrow's debugging adventure.\n\nFollow\n\n## No responses yet\n\n[Help](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[Status](https://medium.statuspage.io/?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[About](https://medium.com/about?autoplay=1&source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[Careers](https://medium.com/jobs-at-medium/work-at-medium-959d1a85284e?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[Press](https://mckornfield.medium.com/pressinquiries@medium.com?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[Blog](https://blog.medium.com/?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[Privacy](https://policy.medium.com/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[Terms](https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[Text to speech](https://speechify.com/medium?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)\n\n[Teams](https://medium.com/business?source=post_page-----d44c7f5526eb---------------------------------------)",

An SDK is a set of tools to build software for a particular platform. These tools also allow an app developer to build an app which can integrate with another program–i.e. a mobile measurement partner ( [MMP](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/mobile-measurement-partner-mmp/)) like Adjust.\n\nSDKs not only let developers create new tools efficiently, but also make the process easier because everything is pre-built. New features just need to be made compatible with the current system.\n\nThere are two types of mobile SDKs:\n\n**Open source SDK:** Code that the public has access to.\n\n**Closed source SDK:** Code that is closely guarded and not easily accessible.\n\n## Tools in a software development kit\n\nSome common tools that may be included in an SDK are:\n\n- **Libraries:** Code for common functions and features, such as user interface controls, networking, and data storage.\n- **Debugging tools:** Find and fix issues in the code.\n- **Documentation:** Information on how to use the various components of the SDK.\n- **Integrated development environments (IDEs):** Tools for writing, testing, and debugging code.\n- **Testing frameworks:** Test code to ensure that it works correctly.\n- **Plug-ins:** Integrations with popular development environments like Eclipse, Visual Studio, or Xcode.\n- **Application programming interface ( [API](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/api/)):** Interact with various features and services of the platform or language.\n- **Sample code:** A demonstration of how to use the APIs and libraries provided in the SDK.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the tools that might be included in an SDK. The specific tools and resources included in a mobile SDK will depend on the platform or programming language that it’s designed for.\n\n### **SDK vs API**\n\nWhile an SDK and an API are related, they serve different purposes. **An SDK is used to create applications for a specific platform or programming language.** An SDK typically _includes_ an API, but it also includes other resources like documentation, sample code, and development tools.\n\nOn the other hand, an API is a set of protocols, routines, and tools that specify how software components should interact with each other. **An API provides a way for developers to access specific features or services of a system or application.** APIs can be used to communicate with software libraries, web services, and operating systems.\n\n## How to use an SDK\n\nA mobile SDK is typically integrated into the app by a developer. The SDK code can be added to the app directly. Throughout the development process, the developer may use debugging tools and testing frameworks provided in the kit to ensure that their code is working correctly.\n\n## SDKs and Adjust\n\nAdjust’s open-source mobile SDK hosts a ton of features which stand out from the rest. For starters, **you only have to integrate one SDK** to begin tracking. The integration process is quick and functions on whatever platform or framework you have.\n\nWe support [SDKs for multiple platforms](https://github.com/adjust/sdks), including an Android SDK, Windows SDK, and an iOS SDK! With the Adjust SDK integrated, you unlock [conversion tracking](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/conversion-tracking/), [session](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/session/) analysis, and standard usage [KPIs](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/kpi/) – all in about five minutes.\n\nWe work hard to minimize the size of our SDK, ensuring that it won’t take up much space on your app. Although the size of the Adjust SDK will vary depending on your integration, you can expect it to add around 50-60 kb to an Android app and between 600 kb (through CocoaPods) and 2,600 kb (through Carthage) to an iOS app.\n\nIn November 2022, Adjust was the first-to-market with our [SKAN 4-ready SDK](https://www.adjust.com/blog/adjust-releases-skan-4-ready-sdk-to-market/), supporting the key functionalities, new features, and measurement capabilities of SKAN 4.\n\n[Our SDKs can be found on Github](https://github.com/adjust/sdks). Being open source allows developers to see exactly what will be integrated. We also take every possible measure to ensure that our SDK is secure: All communications from our SDK are encrypted, and we privately host the servers which handle your data instead of utilizing the cloud.\n\nAdjust’s web SDK facilitates the tracking specifically of [installs](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/install/), sessions, and [events](https://www.adjust.com/glossary/events/) that occur in [web apps](https://www.adjust.com/blog/different-app-types-and-how-they-work/) or on a web page. This enables marketers to track their campaigns from the very first ad view, to a landing page, and then to events–regardless of whether they occur on desktop or mobile web. Activities that occur in different views can therefore be tied together.\n\nNever miss a resource.

They share plenty in common, and sometimes there’s confusion around what they each do.\n\nAt their core, both the SDK and the API enable you to enhance the functionality of your application with relative ease. To deliver on the promise of either or both—and improve the experience both in-house and for end-users—it’s important to understand how both tools work on the backend, how they differ and how they contribute to the overall development process.\n\n## What is an SDK?\n\nSDK stands for software development kit. Also known as a devkit, the SDK is a set of software-building tools for a specific platform, including the building blocks, debuggers and, often, a framework or group of code libraries such as a set of routines specific to an operating system (OS).\n\nA typical SDK might include some or all of these resources in its set of tools:\n\n- **Compiler**: Translates from one programming language to the one in which you will work.\n- **Code samples**: Give a concrete example of an application or web page.\n- **Code libraries** (framework): Provide a shortcut with code sequences that programmers will use repeatedly.\n- **Testing and analytics tools**: Provide insight into how the application or product performs in testing and production environments.\n- **Documentation**: Gives developers instructions that they can refer to as they go.\n- **Debuggers**: Help teams spot errors in their code so they can push out code that works as expected.\n\nOften, at least one API is also included in the SDK because without the API, applications can’t relay information and work together.\n\n## How an SDK works\n\nSDKs provide a comprehensive collection of tools that enable software developers to build software applications faster and in a more standardized way.\n\n[Cloud native](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/cloud-native) mobile app development, for example, leverages Apple’s iOS SDKs or Google’s Android SDKs for that platform. For larger-scale applications, such as enterprise Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and proprietary web and desktop software applications, Microsoft provides the commonly used, open-source .NET SDK.\n\nThe simplicity of an SDK is just as valuable as the tools in the kit. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. Purchase, download and install the “kit” for your platform (for example, premade parts, examples and instructions).\n2. Open and leverage any APIs and all the development tools you need to build a new application, beginning with the integrated development environment (IDE). This is the space where you will do the actual coding and where your compiler is.\n3. Use the instructions, documentation, code samples and testing tools to do the building, which gives you and your team a healthy head-start.\n\n## SDK use cases\n\nSDKs are part and parcel of mobile app development. They have many use cases:\n\n- Programming language-specific SDKs like the JSON and [Java Developer Kit (JDK)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/jvm-vs-jre-vs-jdk) are used to develop programs in those languages in a streamlined, standardized way.\n- Analytics SDKs from Google and others provide data about user behaviors, paths and actions.\n- Monetization SDKs like Google, Facebook and others make it easy for developers to roll advertising out in their existing apps, with the goal of generating revenue.\n\n## SDK benefits\n\nSDKS make developers’ jobs easier by providing these benefits:\n\n- **Access to constituent parts and instructions for software development:** A retail SDK, for example, that pulls in all the things you’d want in your app (for example, favorites, cart, save for later, checkout, etc.).\n- **Faster and smoother integrations**: SDKs simplify the standard processes needed and provide ready access to information needed.\n- **Shorter development cycle, getting products deployed and into market more efficiently**: Because an SDK is built to inform, equip and provide shortcuts to development, developers can focus on developing the product they’ve planned.\n- **Built-in support and expertise**: No need to search for answers or hire out to augment your team; SDKs come pre-loaded with expertise in the code already written and the support documentation included.\n- **Cost control**: All the listed benefits enable you to better adhere to an established budget during development and post-deployment.\n\nNow let’s dive into how that intermediary—the API—works.\n\nIndustry newsletter\n\n### The latest AI trends, brought to you by experts\n\n### Thank you!

Whether working as a stand-alone solution or included within an SDK, an API facilitates communication between two platforms. It does this by allowing its proprietary software to be leveraged by third-party developers. The developers can then enable their own users to indirectly use the service or services provided by the [API solution](https://www.ibm.com/products/api-connect).\n\nYou can also think of an API as a kind of agreement between two parties. The API not only allows for on-demand information exchange. It stipulates how that information should be exchanged.\n\nBecause some APIs provide the interface directly, the terms “API” and “interface” are sometimes used interchangeably.\n\nTo break that down, an API can consist of two things:\n\n- **Technical specifications and documentation**: This information explains how you’ll need to integrate the API to use it effectively.\n- **The interface itself**: You can access it directly via keyword (in the case of a web API) or indirectly from a separate interface (in the case of a [REST API](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/rest-apis)).\n\nA few of the popular APIs are:\n\n- **Web APIs**, which are used to reach web browsers and devices or as their own web services application.\n- **SOAP APIs**, which are a popular choice in cases of heightened data privacy and security.\n- **Open APIs** (or public APIs) and REST (or RESTful) APIs, which are a popular choice for ease of use and maximizing bandwidth.\n- **JSON-RPC**, a goto for cases where asynchronous server calls are needed.\n- **Custom APIs**, for maximum agility with all the moving parts of software development.\n\n## How an API works\n\nAPIs make smooth, efficient integrations between applications possible.\n\nFor example, let’s say you have a real estate application. Your users want to be able to search for available real estate inventory—a service your software already provides. Furthermore, your users want to search for inventory within a certain area—a certain school district, perhaps.\n\nThe most logical solution is to integrate with an established service. Leveraging a geolocation API would enable your application’s end users to use that service to focus on particular inventory without any awareness that the geolocation application is separate.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, here’s what an API call entails:\n\n1. As the application user who needs to complete a task, you initiate the task from your app, creating a request.\n2. The API makes a call to the web server, relaying the request. The API knows where to send the request because it goes to the API endpoint, typically the URL of a server.\n3. The task is then executed by the third-party application, or database, providing the service.\n\n## API use cases\n\nAPIs make many of the digital tools we routinely use possible. Here are three of the many API use cases:\n\n- **Map APIs** are commonly used to customize a map on a web page or mobile application.\n- **Payment APIs** are often used by e-commerce companies so they can offer purchasing flexibility to customers, expanding their potential customer base as a result.\n- **Weather APIs** can enhance the user experience of sports apps, search engines, etc.\n\n## API benefits\n\nAPIs enhance both the development experience and the end-user experience doing the following:\n\n- Connecting disparate software applications for a stronger overall product offering.\n- Shortening the development cycle through automation.\n- Reducing resources that would otherwise need to be allocated for in-house work.\n- Improving brand recognition and trust.\n- Providing new services to end-users with maximum efficiency.\n\n## Do you have to choose between SDK and API?\n\nNo—in fact, as noted above, an SDK often contains at least one API. These two help you in different ways but can and do work together.\n\nAPIs, again, serve to define how different platforms work together. They facilitate interaction through specifications (protocols); and as facilitators, they serve as one of the tools in a complete kit.\n\nSDKs are the complete kit. They go beyond facilitation (though they include it) to provide everything for building new software for a specific platform or programming language.\n\nFor a further breakdown on the relationship between SDKs and APIs, check out this video:\n\n## Challenges and how to address them\n\nThe overwhelming sentiment when it comes to leveraging SDKs and APIs is that they make developing software applications easier and more cost-effective. They’re about as common to developers as email and chat platforms are to any business team.\n\nThat being said, there are some notable challenges that come with using APIs and SDKs. One challenge involves security breaches. Patchwork software development can result in unintended loopholes that can potentially expose personal information of users. There have even been cases of rogue SDK developers shopping around (and sometimes successfully propagating) SDKs capable of fraudulent activity, unbeknownst to the programmers using them.\n\nFor this reason, it is key for teams of all sizes to vet their providers and keep security on their radar throughout the development cycle.\n\nAnother challenge specific to SDKs has been the frequency of updates. When a development house has to support multiple versions of an SDK, it can cause synchronicity issues between that SDK and any APIs and backend systems is uses. In order to avoid end-user issues and security breaches, [DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops) teams need to keep a close eye on versioning.\n\nAvailability is top-of-mind for most development houses—but having control over those development tools is equally critical.\n\n## SDKs, APIs and IBM\n\nInterested in speeding integration development by 300%, reducing costs by more than 33% and maintaining enhanced security, governance and availability?

But how many marketers have actually asked: ”What does SDK stand for?”\n\nTo shed light on the SDK meaning as well as show you how a mobile SDK could benefit your app, read on.\n\n## What is an SDK, Exactly?\n\n[SDK](https://clevertap.com/glossary/sdk/) stands for software development kit or devkit for short. It’s a set of software tools and programs used by developers to create [applications](https://clevertap.com/glossary/app/) for specific platforms.\n\nSDK tools will include a range of things, including libraries, documentation, code samples, processes, and guides that developers can use and integrate into their own apps. SDKs are designed to be used for specific platforms or programming languages.\n\nThus you would need an Android SDK toolkit to build an Android app, an iOS SDK to build an iOS app, a VMware SDK for integrating with the VMware platform, or a Nordic SDK for building Bluetooth or wireless products, and so on.\n\n[iframe](http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/ukVPKoepaa8P9b)\n\n## The Characteristics of a Good SDK\n\nBecause your mobile SDK is meant to be used outside your organization, it has to provide value to other businesses and their developers. That value is dependent on your SDK having the following characteristics:\n\n- Easy to use by other developers\n- Thorough documentation to explain how your code works\n- Enough functionality so it adds value to other apps\n- Does not negatively impact a mobile device’s CPU, battery, or data consumption\n- Plays well with other SDKs\n\nIn short, it just has to work. Ideally, it should work elegantly, but when time is of the essence, as long as it gets the job done, it should be good enough.\n\n## How Will a Mobile SDK Benefit Your Brand?\n\nThere are several distinct advantages to providing an SDK download for your app.\n\n### Quicker Integration -> Shorter Sales Cycles\n\nLet’s face it: if you’re trying to close more deals, having a mobile SDK speeds these deals along. Your devkit will help shorten the sales cycle because it makes integrating with a customer’s existing tech stack much easier.\n\n### Efficient Development -> Faster Deployment\n\nWhen you take into consideration the fact that the average Android app will use around 18.2 third-party SDKs[\\*\\*](http://blog.safedk.com/sdk-economy/state-mobile-sdks-2018/) (even more if your app is a game), you’ll quickly see that no software developer has the time to code every single tool from scratch.\n\n![user experience optimization process](https://clevertap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/placeholder-image.png)\n\nNot when they can use pre-existing SDKs made publicly available by all the best platforms out there. Especially since your highly skilled developers are being paid by the hour to build a world-class app, not to ensure that functionalities like crash reporting, sending mobile notifications, or gathering behavioral analytics are all custom coded.\n\nSay you want a way to share text or images from your app directly into Facebook. Instead of writing the code from scratch, your developer could start by checking out Facebook’s Android SDK toolkit to find code that would work for an Android device. This speeds up deployment by not needing to code from a blank slate.\n\nYou provide that same efficiency to other developers when you build an SDK for your product that they can use to bridge your product with their apps.\n\n### Great Product + SDK -> Increased Reach\n\nIf your product is valuable and its accompanying SDK allows for a generous amount of interoperability, you increase the chances that other tools will want to integrate with your product, which leads to more exposure for your brand.\n\n### Brand Control -> Mitigated Risks\n\nWith an SDK, you have better control over the elements of your user interface that show up in other apps. This allows you to dictate not just how your product integrates with other apps, but also how it looks. All while ensuring the most critical functions remain safe from being tampered with and possibly ruining a user’s experience down the road.\n\n## SDK vs API: Is there a Difference?\n\nBut wait, how is an SDK different from an API?\n\nWe can define API, also known as an [Application Protocol Interface](https://clevertap.com/glossary/api/) (or Application Programming Interface), as an interface between two pieces of software. Basically, it’s code that allows for clearly defined communication between two separate apps.\n\n**API: the Mailman**\n\nThink of an API as a mailman delivering your app’s request to some other software, and then bringing the response back to your app. A simple example: it’s the API that allows communication between Google Calendar and your travel app so that when a user books a trip, it synchronizes to their calendar.\n\n[iframe](https://giphy.com/embed/t9aU3r2d6msWqtZ5Qd)\n\n**SDK: the Post Office/Hardware Store**\n\nLet’s take the metaphor to its logical conclusion here. If the API is a mailman, then what is SDK in that context?\n\nIt’s the post office AND the hardware store combined.\n\nSince it can contain everything necessary to communicate with another software (i.e. one or more APIs) as well as materials that can be used to construct an entirely new app (i.e. code libraries, debugging facilities, technical notes, tutorials, and documentation).\n\nThis could be a source of confusion for non-developers. After all, if both API and SDK can connect software together, doesn’t that mean they’re essentially the same?\n\nIn this case, go back to the SDK meaning: it’s a development kit. The SDK can contain one or more APIs plus essential utilities. The API is just one part of an SDK. Think of the devkit as a larger “container” for an entire array of SDK tools and you’ll be correct.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the end, allowing other brands to use your technology via your mobile SDK opens up opportunities for your brand to reach wider audiences than you can reach on your own. And all it takes is providing a functional SDK tool that other apps can implement and integrate with.\n\n**CleverTap SDKs**\n\nIf you’re curious whether we follow our own advice, head on over to our [Developer Documentation page](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/clevertap-sdks), where you can download our official mobile and web SDKs, server-side libraries, partner integrations, and community-supported projects.

Use this SDK to build Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and Win32 applications for Windows 11, version 24H2 preview and previous Windows releases.\n\nTip\n\n**[Windows App SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/)**\n\nThe Windows App SDK provides a unified set of APIs and tools that are decoupled from the OS and released to developers via NuGet packages. These APIs and tools can be used in a consistent way by any desktop app on Windows 11 and downlevel to Windows 10, version 1809.\n\n## Getting started\n\nYou can get the Windows SDK in two ways: install it from this page by selecting the download link or by selecting “Windows 11 SDK (10.0.26100.0)” in the optional components of the Visual Studio 2022 Installer.\nBefore you install this SDK:\n\n- Review all [system requirements](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk#system-requirements)\n- Exit Visual Studio prior to installation.\n- Review the [Release notes and Known Issues](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk#release-notes-and-known-issues).\n\n[Download the installer >](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2272610)\n\n[Download the .iso >](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2272523)\n\nLast updated: May 2024\n\n## System requirements\n\nThe Windows SDK has the following minimum system requirements:\n\n### Supported operating systems\n\n- Windows 10 version 1507 or higher: Home, Professional, Education, and Enterprise (LTSB and S are not supported for UWP)\n- Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2012 R2 (Command line only)\n- Windows 8.1\n- Windows 7 SP1\n\n(Not all tools are supported on earlier operating systems)\n\n### Hardware requirements\n\n- 1.6 GHz or faster processor\n- 1 GB of RAM\n- 4 GB of available hard disk space\n\n### Additional SDK requirements\n\nInstallation on Windows 8.1 and earlier operating systems requires an Update for [Universal C Runtime in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c). To install through Windows Update, make sure you install the latest recommended updates and patches from Microsoft Update before you install the Windows SDK.\n\n## Samples\n\nWindows app samples are now available through [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples). You can browse the code on GitHub, clone a personal copy of the repository from Git, or [download](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/archive/master.zip) a zipped archive of all the samples. We welcome feedback, so feel free to open an issue within the repository if you have a problem or question. These samples are designed to run on desktop, mobile, and future devices that support the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).\n\n## Previous SDK versions\n\nPreviously released SDKs and emulators, including update details, can be found on the [archive page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive).\n\n### API Light Up\n\nWhen you use new APIs, consider writing your app to be adaptive so that it runs correctly on the widest array of Windows devices. An adaptive app \"lights up\" with new features wherever the devices and Windows version supports them, but otherwise offers only the functionality available on the detected platform version. For implementation details, see the [Version adaptive code article](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/version-adaptive-code).\n\n## Release notes and known issues\n\nWindows 11, Build 10.0.26100 (released 5/22/2024)\n\nInitial release of the 10.0.26100 series, to correspond with the Windows 11, version 24h2 preview.\n\nWindows 11, Build 10.0.22621.3235 (released 2/29/2024)\n\nServicing update 10.0.22621.3235.\n\nWindows 11, Build 10.0.22621.2428 (released 10/24/2023)\n\nServicing update 10.0.22621.2428.\n\nWindows 11, Version 22H2, Build 10.0.22621.1778\n\nUpdate 10.0.22621.1778.

Apps that were linking against irprops.lib can switch to bthprops.lib as a drop-in replacement.\n\n- Moved ENUM tagServerSelection from wuapicommon.h to wupai.h and removed the header. If you would like to use the ENUM tagServerSelection, you will need to include wuapi.h or wuapi.idl.\n\n- The Windows 10 WinRT API Pack lets you add the latest Windows Runtime APIs support to your .NET Framework 4.5+ and .NET Core 3.0+ libraries and apps. To access the Windows 10 WinRT API Pack, see the [Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Contracts nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.Contracts).\n\n- The printf family of functions now [conforms with the IEEE 754 rounding rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/printf-printf-l-wprintf-wprintf-l?view=vs-2019#requirements) when printing exactly representable floating-point numbers and will honor the rounding mode requested via calls to [fesetround](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fegetround-fesetround2). Legacy behavior is available when linking with [legacy\\_stdio\\_float\\_rounding.obj](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/link-options?view=vs-2019).\n\n- Windows App Certification Kit. Several new APIs were added to the Supported APIs list in the App Certification Kit and Windows Store. If there are APIs in the supported list that appear greyed out or disabled in Visual Studio, you can make a small change to your source file, to access them. For more details, see this [known issue](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/86ae092f-a9df-4d2d-8d09-8bf1e93c029c/known-issue-in-visual-studio-a-windows-api-is-greyed-out-and-i-cannot-access-it-even-though-it-is?forum=Win10SDKToolsIssues). [Find more updates to tests](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/windows-app-certification-kit).\n\n- Message Compiler (mc.exe) updates:\n\n - Now detects the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) in .mc files. If the .mc file starts with a UTF-8 BOM, it will be read as a UTF-8 file. Otherwise, if it starts with a UTF-16LE BOM, it will be read as a UTF-16LE file. If the -u parameter was specified, it will be read as a UTF-16LE file. Otherwise, it will be read using the current code page (CP\\_ACP).\n - Now avoids one-definition-rule (ODR) problems in MC-generated C/C++ ETW helpers caused by conflicting configuration macros (e.g. when two .cpp files with conflicting definitions of MCGEN\\_EVENTWRITETRANSFER are linked into the same binary, the MC-generated ETW helpers will now respect the definition of MCGEN\\_EVENTWRITETRANSFER in each .cpp file instead of arbitrarily picking one or the other).\n- Windows Trace Preprocessor (tracewpp.exe) updates:\n\n - Supports Unicode input (.ini, .tpl, and source code) files. Input files starting with a UTF-8 or UTF-16 byte order mark (BOM) will be read as Unicode. Input files that do not start with a BOM will be read using the current code page (CP\\_ACP). For backwards-compatibility, if the -UnicodeIgnore command-line parameter is specified, files starting with a UTF-16 BOM will be treated as empty.\n - Supports Unicode output (.tmh) files. By default, output files will be encoded using the current code page (CP\\_ACP). Use command-line parameters -cp:UTF-8 or -cp:UTF-16 to generate Unicode output files.\n - Behavior change: tracewpp now converts all input text to Unicode, performs processing in Unicode, and converts output text to the specified output encoding. Earlier versions of tracewpp avoided Unicode conversions and performed text processing assuming a single-byte character set. This may lead to behavior changes in cases where the input files do not conform to the current code page. In cases where this is a problem, consider converting the input files to UTF-8 (with BOM) and/or using the -cp:UTF-8 command-line parameter to avoid encoding ambiguity.\n- TraceLoggingProvider.h updates:\n\n - Avoids one-definition-rule (ODR) problems caused by conflicting configuration macros (e.g. when two .cpp files with conflicting definitions of TLG\\_EVENT\\_WRITE\\_TRANSFER are linked into the same binary, the TraceLoggingProvider.h helpers will now respect the definition of TLG\\_EVENT\\_WRITE\\_TRANSFER in each .cpp file instead of arbitrarily picking one or the other).\n - In C++ code, the TraceLoggingWrite macro has been updated to enable better code sharing between similar events using variadic templates.\n- Signing your apps. Device Guard signing is a Device Guard feature that is available in Microsoft Store for Business and Education, which allows enterprises to guarantee every app comes from a trusted source. See the [documentation about Device Guard Signing](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/msix/package/signing-package-device-guard-signing).\n\n- SDK headers have been updated to address errors when compiling using the standard-conformant C preprocessor in the MSVC compiler cl.exe (/Zc:preprocessor, introduced in VS 2019 v16.6).\n\n- Fixed: “GdiplusTypes.h does not compile with NOMINMAX”. [See Visual Studio Feedback](https://developercommunity2.visualstudio.com/t/GdiplusTypesh-does-not-compile-with-NOM/727770).\n\n- When building with /std:c11 or /std:c17, you now get:\n\n - C99 tgmath.h\n - C11 static\\_assert in assert.h\n - C11 stdalign.h\n - C11 stdnoreturn.h\n- Clang/LLVM for Windows v11 targeting ARM64 is not compatible with the latest winnt.h\n\n - As a workaround, use the previous version of the Windows 10 SDK (build 19041), or clang/LLVM for Windows v10 when targeting ARM64 platforms\n- DirectXMath (including version 3.16 in this release) is not compatible with Clang/LLVM for Windows on ARM64.\n\n - As a workaround, use the latest version of DirectXMath, available from NuGet, vcpkg, or GitHub. These versions include the required hot fixes (version 3.16b).\n - [//www.nuget.org/packages/directxmath](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxmath)\n - [//github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/directxmath](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/directxmath)\n - [//github.com/microsoft/DirectXMath](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXMath)\n- The case of some header files were changed, to normalize them for case-sensitive file systems:\n\n\n - OAIdl.h, ObjIdl.h, ObjIdlbase.h, OCIdl.h, Ole2.h, OleAuto.h, and OleCtl.h were all made lower-case.\n - For Clang/LLVM for Windows builds, to support both older version and the latest Windows 10 SDK without warnings, add `-Wno-nonportable-system-include-path` to the CLI, or the following #pragma in source:\n\n`#ifdef __clang__`\n\n`#pragma clang diagnostic ignored \"-Wnonportable-system-include-path\"`\n\n`#endif`\n\nWindows 10 SDK, Version 2004 servicing update (released 12/16/2020)\n\nThis release contains the following files. If you encounter these issues, we recommend that you update your version of the SDK as soon as possible to avoid them:\n\n- Resolved unpredictable and hard to diagnose crashes when linking both umbrella libraries and native OS libraries (for example, onecoreuap.lib and kernel32.lib)\n- Resolved issue that prevented AppVerifier from working\n- Resolved issue that caused WACK to fail with “Task failed to enable HighVersionLie”\n\n## More resources\n\n- [Downloads and tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads)\n\nGet the latest editions of Visual Studio and Windows 10 development tools.\n\n- [SDK archive](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive)\n\nFind previous releases of the Window SDK and other tools.\n\n- [Windows blog](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/)\n\nStay in touch with the latest SDK flights by subscribing to our blog.\n\n- [Windows lifecycle fact sheet](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet)\n\nFind the key dates for Windows release updates and end of support."
